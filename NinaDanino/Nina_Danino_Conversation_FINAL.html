<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Shaped
over the course of a back-and-forth email conversation between artist Nina
Danino and curator Helen de Witt over several months in 2024, this discussion
was initiated in 2024 when Nina Danino returned to a series of conversations
she had undertaken with artists in 2020, in preparation for their publication
by LUX as an online collection. This dialogue is the final instalment in the
series, which was originally initiated by Nina Danino just before the COVID-19
pandemic started in 2020. As the interviewer in the other conversations, her
filmmaking was not the main focus of these earlier discussions with women
practitioners whose work she has reflected on over the years. This sixth
conversation in the series, this exchange aimed to find space to reflect on
Nina Danino’s own practice as a filmmaker. Indeed, her examination of how
artists are inscribed in/through material filmic practices, as discussed in the
other discussions in the collection, stems from her own making and are
significant to her long-term formulation of ideas around the subjective in
writing and filmmaking.<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">[1]</a>
</span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">
    Helen de Witt has shown and written
about Nina Danino’s work since the premiere of her film <i>Temenos</i> at the Lux Centre in Hoxton (London) in 1998 – a programme
that included her other films “<i>Now I am
yours”</i>, (1992) and <i>Stabat Mater</i>,
(1990).<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #0000FF;">[2]</a> As a programmer, Helen de Witt’s mode of engagement with a diverse array of
film practices and her sustained writing on Nina Danino’s work bring a depth of
knowledge and a sense of affinity framed by these long-term interactions. Helen
de Witt has written at length about Nina Danino’s work, including for the
sleeve notes of the film soundtrack CD of <i>Temenos
</i>(1998).<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #0000FF;">[3]</a>
Her essay ‘Transfiguration and Transmediation’ is also included in the
monograph <i>Visionary Landscapes: The Films
of Nina Danino</i> (Black Dog Publishing, 2005) and the essay <span style="color:black">‘The Persistence of Spirit: The Films of Nina Danino’ was
published on <i>Luxonline</i> in 2004</span>.<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #0000FF;">[4]</a>
These writings explore themes of sacred place and cinema, a woman-centred
filmic experience of ‘jouissance’ (discussed in the conversation below) and her
approach to the religious as mediated through materiality, using ‘the cinematic
apparatus as a means of revelation’.<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #0000FF;">[5]</a> Helen

programme – shown at the Lux Centre in 2005 – included <i>Temenos</i> and in her long-term role as a Curator at the British Film
Institute (BFI) working on the Experimenta artists’ moving image strand of the
London Film Festival, she also later showed <i>I
Die of Sadness Crying for You </i>(2019), part of a deep-dive screening and
discussion at the 63rd LFF in 2019, just when Nina Danino initiated this series
of conversations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">
        For their written exchange, Helen de
Witt revisited Nina Danino’s films, connecting these works to the
collaborations and networks surrounding her practice – an important aspect of
all the interviews in this collection, which consider <i><span style="color:black">Experimental film and the subject/ive at the
London Film-makers’ Co-op</span></i><span style="color:black">. </span>From
Nina Danino’s time as a student at the Royal College of Art in the 1980s to
networks around the LFMC, cultures of experimental film, including funding
bodies and organisations in the 1990s and 2000s and the demise of the London
Film-makers’ Co-op (LFMC), their discussions span a number of important
transitions over their respective careers.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Your work has been made over four decades now, and your practices
have evolved in complex and fascinating ways. It might be useful to start at
the beginning, to talk about how you emerged as an artist and filmmaker,
especially as I’ve been revisiting your films over the last few weeks. I’ve
been thinking about the autobiographical elements across your filmmaking. You
were born in Gibraltar – which makes you British although not born in Britain.<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">[7]</a>
How has this unique cultural setting had a continuing presence in your
filmmaking, could you talk about it further? In what way specifically has it
affected your practice? </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">
I left Gibraltar and came to
study in London in the 1970s. I have lived in London ever since – so my
formation as an artist has really been in London. Nevertheless, many of the
sources in my films and materials draw on connections to Gibraltar and southern
Spain. The singing of a <i>saeta</i>, in <i>Stabat Mater</i> (1990) comes directly from
the south.<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">[8]</a> Gibraltar is an expanding territory in other works such as <i>Meteorologies</i> (2013), <i>I Die
of Sadness Crying For You</i> (2018) and <i>The
Straits Trilogy </i>on which I am working now, which will be filmed in
Andalusia. Important and deep sources such as the voice, music and cinema come
from there and are evident in many of my films. </span></p>

You mention moving to London at a time when cinema and
experimental film cultures were really thriving, here and all over Europe. As
well as these formative themes, what major influences or works by other artists
did you discover in London that inspired you? Where there other influences of
any form, from any other places or periods of time? </span></p>

  <b>Nina Danino:</b>
  </p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Before London, cinema had an impact – one film in particular, <i>The Gospel According to St. Matthew</i>
(1964) by Pier Paolo Pasolini, which was screened for my school in Gibraltar in
around 1968, two years or so after it won a prize awarded by the International
Catholic Film Office (around 1965-67)</span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>.
<span style="color:black">The neo realism in the film stayed with me. I had an
out-of-mind, out-of-body awareness of my own experience of the suspension of
disbelief. I felt at that moment I was initiated into a cinema of a different
order. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">
  I happened to see <i>La Strada</i> (1954) by Federico Fellini on
the state-run Spanish television channel TVE. I have strong early cinema
memories of Spanish children’s films, which I saw at the Theatre Royal in
Gibraltar (now demolished). At the 1950s Queen’s Cinema in Gibraltar, I saw the
Mexican version of <i>La Caperucita Roja</i>
[Little Red Riding Hood] (1960), directed </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>by
Roberto Rodríguez, which <span style="color:black">struck me with terror.<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #0000FF;">[9]</a>
Later, my film <i>Communion</i> (2010) was
projected as a film installation in the same Queen’s Cinema building in
Gibraltar – so I returned to these impressions in some ways. At the
installation screening, a black-and-white image of a young girl in white was
projected on the 25-foot cinema screen in the vast 860-seat empty cinema for
three days in silent vigil.<a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">[10]</a></p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I revisited the music
culture from my memory later, through YouTube, when I started to research <i>I Die of Sadness Crying For You </i>(2019).
There was the Spanish and Latin American sound but to this was added the new
British invasion and rock music. There was the local Gibraltar Broadcasting
Corporation (GBC) Radio and British forces radio, where we got all the new
music in the 1960s and 1970s. There was also progressive music, live jazz and
rock bands. <i>Bare Wires</i> (1968) by John
Mayall was my first album, and the track <i>Don't
Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking For Her Hand In The Snow) </i>on the album <i>Fly</i> (1971) by Yoko Ono and The Plastic
Ono Band was my first avant-garde rock song. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">
  The Straits [of Gibraltar]
in the late 1960s were also on the hippie trail to Tangier in Morocco, so all
the psychedelic music flowed through the air waves and on albums, but it was
beyond the horizon. Because Spain was under fascist dictatorship Gibraltar was
blockaded, so music represented freedom<a href="#_ftnref11" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[11]</a>
Eventually British and American music overtook the Spanish and Latin music of
the earlier generation. I logged this complex music network via my research in
the GBC sound library and recorded conversations between myself and my mother
going through these logs and remembering the vast range of songs. As she has a
good memory, between us we mapped a music territory. T</span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>he soundtrack t<span style="color:black">o
my film <i>I Die of Sadness Crying For You </i>(2019</span>)
focussed on the powerful music of the Spanish Copla genre and the immense sounds
of their female singers from the 1930s and 1940s, which were still very strong
till the 1970s and 1980s. It died away as Spain modernised but more recently
has been reclaimed as a popular genre in Spain today. <sup></sup></span></p>

      <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I was a literary student. I
learned how to read literary texts, analyse and to produce literary criticism.
One of the revolutionary texts was the Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s
essay on the ‘Imagination and the Fancy’ (1817), which unlocked important ideas
for me very early on. Coleridge lays out the differences between the two – one
leads to art or to original complex unifying synthesis and the other is a
lesser form which finds its outlet in illustrative, literal and associative
forms. The important aspect of this essay is that he explains exactly these
routes and argues for them in a methodical and evidenced way that I found
totally convincing. It unlocked and informed my method of criticism and
analysis of art and of all works, showing how they can be judged critically. </span></p>

      <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Another important influence
was the BBC documentary <i>A Question of
Feeling</i> (1970) about The Locked Room experiment, which was televised by
GBC, the local television station.<a href="#_ftnref12" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[12]</a>
The Locked Room was one of the, if not the, most radical and notorious
pedagogical experiments in the history of British art schools, where tutors at
St. Martin’s School of Art [later Central Saint Martin’s, CSM] locked students
in a room and told them to make art, which they also weren’t allowed to keep.
Before watching that I was set to study English Literature but seeing the
documentary decided it. I was so taken aback by what I saw, the tutors going
around with paper bags over their heads and the students not speaking. I felt
that I needed to be part of this because it seemed something radical and was
totally outside of my sphere of knowledge or understanding of what art was. I
was literally awestruck and I wanted to find out what it was about, so I decided
to go to art school instead. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Before starting the BA, I did Foundation. It was there that I was
invited to performances that took place in the ‘A’ course in Sculpture
(infamous for the Locked Room experiment). They were not wholly understandable
and I felt this was part of the interest to me.<a href="#_ftnref13" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[13]</span></sup><?endif?></span></sup></a>
I then continued to the Painting Department where I studied between 1973–77. In
the late 1970s, abstraction was still the dominant style. I made colour field
paintings also using household paints. They were in beautiful pastel colours,
gloss and matt. Artists Jenny Durrant, Gillian Ayres and John Hoyland were my
main tutors over the three years of the course; but there was very little
actual teaching. It was more listening to tutors as they talked indirectly
about their interests, influences and improvised thoughts on their own painting
and social circle. I can see now that it was a radical non-pedagogy, it threw
you back upon yourself as an artist. They didn’t really teach anything <i>per se</i>, yet it gave you the key to
taking authority for your own decisions. Abstract painting, however, was under
critique or even attack from critical theory and conceptual approaches to art
which were favoured by Complementary Studies when I was there.<a href="#_ftnref14" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[14]</span></sup><?endif?></span></sup></a>
There was also filmmaker and artist Malcolm Le Grice’s Experimental Film Unit
(which he set up in 1967), housed in the basement of the Charing Cross Road
building. The Painting Department was on the upper floors and in part due to
this proximity, it was fairly natural that painting students also started
making films (such as <span>Gill
Eatherley, Annabel Nicolson and William Raban to name a few). I continued in
the Painting studios</span>.<a href="#_ftnref15" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[15]</span></sup><?endif?></span></sup></a>
</span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Today, looking back I would
argue that the insistent Marxist criticism of abstraction and the peer male
culture around painting eventually caused me to question painting and I began
to find that my painting flow became blocked. I lost my enjoyment of it.
However, it was through abstract painting that I found an affiliation with
modernist avant-garde film and questions of medium specificity and materiality.

Having discounted painting but incorporating the critical thinking
gained from the Foundation, you made your first film, <i>First Memory</i> (1980-81), a slide/tape piece that used Super 8 and
16mm. It was bold in its lack of imagery and use of blank space and was when
you started using your voice, which is an important aspect of all your films
since. How did you come to make such a complex multimedia work? What were you
seeking to convey through this technique? </span></p>

  <b>Nina Danino:</b>
  </p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I didn’t discount painting, I rejected it. At the time, I was
reading Simone De Beauvoir and other existential writers and playwrights around
her like Albert Camus, </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Françoise
Sagan, <span style="color:black">Violette Leduc and Jean-Paul </span>Sartre<span style="color:black">. I was identifying with and studying the women characters
in these novels. I felt that the philosophical implications of romantic love
for women which for De Beauvoir was to be based on ‘authentic’ love and freedom
did not deliver freedom to the women characters in the novels nor by the women writers.
They seemed to entrap the women protagonists in passive conditions as
characters and as women. I took this as a proposal to study the state of
femaleness in image and sound when I went on to study in the Department of
Environmental Media at the Royal College of Art (after St. Martin’s), which
focussed on time-based areas of contemporary media, performance, slide/tape,
video, photography and audio. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">While studying in the
department of Environmental Media I used slide/tape to make the first version
of <i>First Memory</i>, I recorded narration
and used a graph to keep the sound and images tracked and timed. I inserted
blanks to create an interval for reflection and duration, thus no image became
part of the work in the slide/tape projection. Since then, I have used black
film in some works, most recently, in <i>Solitude</i>
(2022). I love black film and have just made a draft film using black and I
also wrote essays on black film as a medium of resistance to representation and
as a metaphor for visionary experience in <i>Temenos</i>
(1998).<a href="#_ftnref16" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[16]</span></sup><?endif?></span></sup></a>
This created intervals of time for the viewer’s reflection and was most likely
related to what I was now reading at the time – objective nouveau romans by
Alain Robbe Grillet like <i>Jalousie</i>
(1957) and <i>L’Immortelle</i> (1968), which
also influenced the films of writer and artist Marguerite Duras as well as
schools of structuralist thinking in literature and formal film. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Outside as it were, there
was feminist work about gender, identity and social issues but I felt that
representation itself was radical. The ontology of time-based mediums,
slide/tape and later, single screen 16mm film was important to how I was
structuring these thoughts: how one image invited a speculative relationship
with the next image and the relationship of image to sound and time and how
this was withholding representation or presenting non-representation. I wrote
about formal means and female representation in <i>First Memory</i> in an (unpublished) essay at the time, ‘Image and
Narrative’ (1981). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">In terms of mounting multimedia as you
say, it was a process of paring down. The original multimedia two-screen
installation of <i>First Memory</i> (1980)
included slide/tape, Super 8 and sound. It was only shown once (due to the
complexity of the installation) as part of the ‘About Time’<i> </i>programme of the exhibition <i>Women’s
Images of Men</i> at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) London (1980).
The final version, <i>First Memory</i>
(1981) was a single screen 16mm film and it premiered as part of the <i>New Contemporaries</i> exhibition, again at
the ICA in 1981. It was then shown again as part of the London Film-makers’
Co-operative (LFMC) Summer Show (6-11 July 1981). A two screen slide/tape
version was also shown as part of the Degree Show at the Royal College of Art
that same year, this time comprising only slide/tape as well as the 16mm film.<a href="#_ftnref17" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[17]</a>Each time, the installation and
configuration of media varied. </span></p>

  <b>Nina Danino:</b>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I began to learn about experimental film from the students who
studied under the artist Peter Gidal at the RCA Film School, people like Lucy
Panteli, Michael Mazière, Joanna Woodward and Rob Gawthrop. Artist and LFMC
founder Steve Dwoskin also taught at the RCA, and I saw a number of his works
around voyeurism. Artists Lis Rhodes (whom I also spoke to for this series of
conversations) and Peter Gidal were my tutors at Environment Media. Peter
Kardia (who I’ve previously mentioned) created a structural and sculptural
framework for teaching at St. Martin’s, which he then brought to Environmental
Media at the RCA. The pedagogical focus was on attention to the means, the
material, the process and formal concerns rather than resolution. However, I
did have to apply resolution to <i>First
Memory</i> as a time-based work. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">At the time I was using
slide/tape and the structural novel and ideas of representation of women and
already making visually and formally self-aware time-based work. I didn’t have
a concept of making <i>First Memory</i> in
the context of other experimental films but as a standalone object that
attended to ontological time-based concerns, the medium and the form. Part of
this engagement with medium involved making a 16mm film from slides, using
colour reversal Fuji and there was the excitement of the new medium as well as
transferring images from one medium to another. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I think my reason for
affiliating myself to experimental film was because it was self-critical,
rigorous and free from film standardisation. I wanted to work in a form that I
could construct and structure myself, so I moved to 16mm, which was also the medium
for experimental film. I was not thinking about it being an experimental film.
It was a film. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I was introduced to the LFMC by Lucy Panteli and Michael Mazière
while at the RCA. They very much pointed out that it existed. Lucy Panteli
painted a radiant picture of it as somewhere where we could continue with our
films after the RCA. It seemed a paradisical situation and I became a member in
1981 or early in 1982, somewhere around the time I showed <i>First Memory</i> at the LFMC Summer Show, which showcased new films in
distribution. As well as being a workshop to make film, for me what was
important was to go to the cinema and to see films, to have new work shown with
other new work. The culture was to attend and support work by friends and
colleagues. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">When I became a member, the
LFMC was in its final home, a building leased from British Rail on Gloucester
Avenue in Camden, which they shared with the London Musicians’ Collective.<a href="#_ftnref18" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[18]</a>
When people say it was a hostile place I think it was the run-down atmosphere
of the building rather than the people being unfriendly – the building
definitely set the tone of the LFMC. The cinema, as I said, was for me a
meeting place but I can see how the building could make it feel intimidating. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">At this time, I was also
freelancing as an assistant editor at the BBC and in the independent sector.<a href="#_ftnref19" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[19]</a>
I was making the film <i>Close to Home</i>
(1982-85) for which I bought a Steenbeck flatbed, used for editing and viewing
film, and set myself up at home, as I was working irregular hours and couldn’t
get to the Co-op to edit. This is why it took three years to make. I later did
the labour-intensive optical printing of <i>Stabat
Mater</i> (1990) with artist Nick Collins at the Co-op. The blowing up process
from Super 8 to 16mm on the optical printer was originally scheduled over five
days and went on for weeks. Through cinema attendance I got to know everyone
there very well – </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Susan Stein and Pete
Millner were the Workshop Organisers, artists Anna Thew and Martin Lugg were
Distribution Organisers and the LFMC cinema in the 1980s was variously
programmed by Michael Mazière, Cordelia Swan and Cathleen Maitland Carter,
whose approaches were quite different. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Later when digital video
came out in the 1990s, I used corporate and independent editing suites in Soho
on their downtime, mostly through my contacts in film and TV. With facilitation
by producer </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Janet Marbrook, <span style="color:black">I was able to do post-production for “<i>Now I am yours”</i> (1992) at the studio of Chrysalis Television on
Chalk Farm Road (up the road from the Co-op), which was beyond what the budget
would have been able to afford. I also used Filmatic Laboratories at Colville
Road, a commercial laboratory favourable to experimental filmmakers thanks to
Len Thornton who was a laboratory manager. I had to fit in making <i>Close to Home</i> around freelance editing,
so I needed reliable technical systems. At the time, I was very split. I saw
working as a freelance editor as a job and really, I just wanted to make my
films, but (as discussed with Jayne Parker in another conversation in the series),
I now look back gratefully at the training that I received as it has been
invaluable to my methods of editing since. </span></span></p>

As you indicate, this early work was made and appeared at a
particularly rich moment in the history of experimental filmmaking in London,
the final period of the dominance of structural materialist practice as well as
the opening-up of industry opportunities to non-union makers in the 1980s. To
what extent did you feel your work as different and how did you find these

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">In another conversation in this series, I spoke with Anna Thew,
about this. The idea of ‘allies’ in making practice is interesting. Anna
observes that there was a judgmental and superior attitude by some
second-generation structural filmmakers, making it difficult to situate your
work – but not those from the first generation. I agree with her – as I
mentioned, I had experienced this already in my painting studies from male
peers. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">In another conversation
within this series, Dutch filmmaker Barbara Meter talks about the ambivalence
of our positions as women in experimental film as a male-dominated modernist
art culture. At the time, I felt that my work did not wholly fit into the structural
ethos due to its subjective voice and use of narration. It was not objective
enough. Yet, despite the structural dominance at this time the LFMC
incorporated and showed many diverse films and practices. Still, my affiliation
was with an experimental structural approach. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">What was important to me about the LFMC was that I was able to
meet and talk to other artists. At the LFMC we didn’t call ourselves artists
but filmmakers. Film was the specific nexus through which we connected and
realised our passion. I talked to people like Guy Sherwin, Nicky Hamlyn and
Nick Collins. There were also expanded networks and miscellaneous events
loosely connected to the LFMC, for example Guy Sherwin hosted home screenings
where I met Barbara Meter and Anabel Nicholson. This experimental film culture
also mixed generations with first-generation filmmakers, being there and
showing their work at screenings, and going to <i>The Engineer</i> pub afterwards (across the road from the LFMC/LMC).
John Smith, I recall, commenting wryly on screenings in the pub. At Gloucester
Avenue I was able to reconnect with friends from the RCA like Lucy Panteli and
Michael Mazière and with Jean Matthee from The </span><span style='font-family:
"Helvetica Neue"'>Slade and Royal College of Art (RCA) Women’s Group, which was
active between 1981 and 1982 (and included other artists such as Mona Hatoum
and Laura Ford). <span style="color:black">Filmmakers such as Vicky Smith,
Steve Farrer, David Finch, Will Milne and David Larcher were also important. I
mention a lot of men’s names but, despite the feminist contexts and theories
with which I was engaging, they were my network. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">For much of the 1980s I was
also a member of the Undercut Collective editing <i>Undercut </i>magazine. The first issue was published in Spring 1981. I
joined soon after in 1982 and was involved until the last issue was published
in 1990. Although the magazine was subtitled “the magazine from the London
Filmmakers’ Co-op” the collective was independent from the LFMC Executive
Board. We had monthly production meetings on Saturdays at Gloucester Avenue,
creating another circle, among people like the critics Michael O’Pray and
Al[A.L.] Rees, scholar Gillian Swanson,
artists like Pete Milner, Nicky Hamlyn, John Woodman, Michael Mazière and
shorter-term members as well as all the contributors who often became part of
the entourage. These were the networks and people through which I engaged with
the LFMC – through viewing, screening, discussion, writing, practice and social
connection. </span></p>

LFMC – of historical avant-garde, underground films and new films in
distribution, films by peers and first-generation structural filmmakers. I have
an almost full collection of LFMC programmes, largely the screenings I went to,
as I picked them up there. The ones that stood out for me at these screenings
(and that I remember now) were </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Cleo
Übelmann’s <i><span style="color:black">Mano
Destra </span></i><span style="color:black">(1986), <i>Neon Queen </i>(1986) by Jean Matthee, Nina Menkes’ <i>Magdalena Viraga</i> (1986) and Andy
Warhol’s American underground film, <i>Chelsea
Girls</i> (1966), of which I have a predominantly sonic recollection,
particularly the dissonant clatter and harsh sound rebounding in the cinema. I
was excited to see the camera-centred film <i>News
from Home</i> (1977) by Chantal Akerman, a new feminist visual economy of the
personal. Marguerite Duras’ sensual cinema, particularly the screening of <i>India Song</i> (1975) at the LFMC, left an
impact and I was absorbed by her somnolent, oneiric films. I was utterly
seduced and fascinated by ‘longeurs’ or tedious passages – training us about
attentive viewing. Not to mention properly difficult films such as Peter
Gidal’s <i>Room Film </i>(1973). It was not
always pleasurable. But essential. <s></s></span></span></p>

It’s interesting to think about how these influences might connect
to your practice. Your work is hugely distinctive in the way it integrates your
influences, the themes in your films. In <i>Stabat
Mater</i> (1990) we see a statue of the Virgin Mary alongside narration of the
final part of James Joyce's novel <i>Ulysses
</i>(1920), connecting to your early literary interests but also Gibraltar,
where it takes place. The film seems to be about a return to a kind of home,
but instead of it being a place of comfort, it is found to be disruptive. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Yes, it is about disruption and movement to be dynamic and not
become a representation that can be fully grasped. Yet it still has to have
comprehensibility and unity as a film and not be chaos, so that it can make
that jump into the limitless void. It was disruptive and probably unsettling to
viewers due to the <i>saetas</i> and
religious images. At its premiere screening at the LFMC, the cinema was packed
but at the end it was met with a long pause of silence.<a href="#_ftnref20" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[20]</span></sup><?endif?></span></sup></a>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">As mentioned, I did situate myself within the structuralist canon
so to speak. Gidal’s essay <i>Theory and
Definition of Structural/Materialist Film </i>(1976) was very influential, as
it theorised an objective framework for a materialist film practice.<a href="#_ftnref21" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none;">[21]</span></sup><?endif?></span></sup></a>

and duration were, in retrospect, foundational to my work. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Much feminist film theory in

Leading on from that, given the importance of structure in your
work, could you talk about how the unconscious works within your films, and
their transformative power on the viewer? How do you want the viewer to be
transfixed or transfigured through your relationship with your work? </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The transformative power on the viewer is rather unlocatable, so
no evidenced method can be applied to show how the viewer might be transfixed
or transfigured – but the same can be said for Kristeva’s ‘semiotic’ – there is
no real evidence for such a register. Such a concept as ‘the feminine’ also
eludes representation necessarily. For Kristeva “Femininity and the semiotic
do, however, have one thing in common: their marginality. As the feminine is
defined as marginal under patriarchy so the semiotic is marginal to language”.<a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

The interesting part is how these theories combine with the materials of film
and ineffable aspects of cinema to impart a metaphysical experience. This may
have been what impacted me when I experienced Pasolini’s <i>The Gospel According to St. Matthew</i> when I was younger. These
elements came together or traversed through one person, a viewer in a unique
moment, leaving an impression like a ‘transverberation’. According to the
French film critic Henri Agel, cinema is already religious through the potential
of impression. </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>For Henri Agel the
spiritual potential of cinema and what he calls the soul is in all aspects of
the conception of the film.As Sarah
Cooper writes, “from its inspiration and its production through to its
interpretation. It is neither unlocatable not locatable in representation but
manifests itself through the impact on the viewer”<span style="color:black">.<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">What I most enjoyed about working with 16 mm was editing on the
Steenbeck. I enjoyed the rhythm created to establish pace and the moment, the
frame of the cut. This was part of the choreography of the body and the
machine. I felt a bodily engagement with it. Both <i>First Memory </i>and <i>Close to Hom</i>e
are Steenbeck-structured films. In the 1990s with formats such as VHS, Beta Sp,
Digi Beta or Hi8, my editing moved to offline. I did a 16mm assembly edit of
the silent film <i>Sorelle Povere di Santa
Chiara</i> (2016) on a Steenbeck for the pleasure of revisiting the pulse of
mechanical editing and handling celluloid. </span></p>

This sense of structure in many ways creates the atmosphere in
your films in incredible and unexpected ways. <i>“Now I am Yours”</i> (1992) is an ecstatic religious rapture inspired
by Bernini’s Saint Teresa of Avila statue in Rome, juxtaposed with gorgeous,
coloured flowers and baroque interiors, which hold us as if displaced from the
earth into the heavens. The sound-music and voice are incredibly powerful. How
did you bring together all the elements within the film to create such a
transfiguring experience for the audience? </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The master footage of Bernini’s statue, <i>The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa</i> was filmed in black-and-white on 16mm
at 24fps at the Cornaro Chapel in Rome. It is unbelievable that we were able to
film in the Cornaro Chapel. It was an unforgettable experience. In <i>“Now I am yours”</i> I didn’t know if it
would be possible to create a dynamic construction just with the 16mm. It
wasn’t. My impulse was to bring the figure of Teresa to life from the stone
where, I felt, she was trapped as a woman. However, at that time, I saw her as
a writer rather than a mystic because I was strongly atheist. This
‘resuscitation’ was a drive because it was also about mourning and death. There
is a lot of burial in the film and the impulse to ‘bring alive’. The way to
this resuscitation was through the mixes of S8, Hi 8, VHS,16mm, Beta Sp and
extracts from the 35mm film <i>Teresa de
Jesús</i> (1962) in the completed film. I feel it is all these together that
create the mystical ecstasy and the body of the film. To me, this was subjected
to the inscriptive drive and the textual body of St. Teresa and are networked
and part of this body. Theoretically, it mixes the semiotic, psychoanalysis,
mystical Christianity, materiality and dialectics to create the transfiguring
experience. The film is founded on the study of St. Teresa’s mystical writings
and on knowing the material frame by frame. I recite St. Teresa’s writings in a
mode of reading/speaking accompanied by layers of voice and wordless vocals. It
was new to invite a saint into this self-inscriptive experimental film. </span></p>

film <i>Accatone</i> (1961) with location
sound recorded during Holy Week processions in Andalucia. This film seems to be

and image. After I made <i>Stabat Mater</i>
the others followed in editing style and involved a dynamic relationship of
image to sound. It is a procession film shot in Granada and Seville. I wanted
to get in amongst the crowd, to be part of it, and Hi 8 and Super 8 enabled
this as both are light cameras. I had a sound recordist with me, and we roamed
through the processions and the streets. It is the music and the crowd that
supplements the enfolding collective jouissance and this is what I tried to
immerse myself in and to capture in the film. Today I probably would not
include the speaking voice but use more of the wonderful music we recorded on
the street. I may make a new version or another procession film.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I was introduced to Carolyn Gill’s ‘Time and the Image’
seminars by Jean Matthee. I attended from 1990 until 1998 on and off. This gave
me important study continuity when the Co-op was not functioning very well. I
also contributed and presented my work. The first year introduced French
feminist literary theory by people like Kristeva, Luce Irigaray and Hélène
Cixous and it was groundbreaking for me.<a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[25]</a>
Because of these influences, in the 1990s psychoanalysis and a different notion
of the subject and woman entered my work and the aspects of jouissance I was
exploring. Feminist literary theory and French feminist writing ultimately
enabled me to depart from formalism and the negative aesthetics of <i>First Memory</i> (1981) and <i>Close to Home</i> (1982-85) to the euphoric
verticality and completely new visual experimental film language of <i>Stabat Mater </i>(1990) and “<i>Now I am yours”</i> (1992).<a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[26]</a>
I attended many conferences, events, talks and discussions on psychoanalysis in
literary criticism and film studies. I also took part in the ground-breaking
conference <i>Psychoanalysis and the Image</i>,
where I showed <i>“Now I am yours”</i>.<a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">[27]</a>However, on the whole, psychoanalysis
was not really favoured in experimental film circles – only Michael O’Pray
wrote on it in relation to avant-garde film. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">For me, psychoanalysis was
vertiginous and fascinating and a new step into understanding the subject
through ideas of the drive, jouissance, concepts of plenitude and loss and
‘woman as a blind spot’ or ‘lack’ in the signifying system – a place to fill with
fullness. These concepts were no longer filtered through stable observation but
through an unstable subject of emotional energy, pulsion, rhythm and other
forces beyond language. I would not say pre-verbal exactly, which seems to
imply regression. As mentioned before, I was favourable to Kristeva’s concept
of the semiotic as a pulsion in literary theory, transposing it to experimental
film. Lacan’s concepts of the phallic and mystical jouissance were exciting,
which I mixed as one.<a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[28]</a>
Thus, these co-joined around experimental film as a unique place for the
feminine as the subject of creation and interdeterminacy, instability,
improvisation, structure and heightened register. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Texts on the relationship
between psychoanalysis and cinema were naturally important. The art critic
Rosalind Krauss threw light on the male modernist vision machine of avant-garde
film. Kaya Silverman explored the maternal and woman’s voice in cinema, which
was elucidating.<a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[29]</a>
Even though I had already formed my own idea of the voice to counter the notion
of a male voiceover. I also read male writers on the voice as an object in
cinema but they resonated less with my interest in the woman’s voice and the
language of experimental film.<a href="#_ftn30" id="_ftnref30" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[30]</a>
</span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">In my practice and research
at this time I mixed literary theory and psychoanalysis with ideas relating to
experimental film. <i>Stabat Mater</i> mixed
experimental structuralist aesthetics with the textual rhetoric of James
Joyce’s modernist novel <i>Ulysses</i>
(1920), adding </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Cixous’<span style="color:black"> concept of ‘ecriture feminine’ as poetic writing – where
the subject is speaking from a place of plenitude.<a href="#_ftn31" id="_ftnref31" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[31]</a>
Kristeva’s notion of the pulsion of the semiotic and Lacan’s feminine circulate
in “<i>Now I am yours</i>”, and of course,
in my filmmaking I connected the religious as a heightened discourse with these
feminist frameworks. I was creating my own unorthodox mixes of these theories:
the films intended to generate and perform their own theory. </span></span></p>

It was shot on 35mm using Hollywood 3-point light in the manner of the

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">When I had my Communion in the 1960s, I had my studio photographic
portrait taken and like every other child’s, it is sublimely beautiful. I
wanted to achieve extraordinary photographic beauty in a film study but to push
it to its limits. Technically, it is the same system of lighting as
traditionally devised for the face of a star in Hollywood. The Communion
portrait draws on the metaphor of light to represent the transition from
innocence to a life of conscience in a child of around seven years which is the
meaning of the sacrament of Communion. My film also references transfigurative
moments in cinema portraits of young actors’ faces, such as Renee Falconetti in
Carl Theodor Dreyer’s film <i>The Passion of
Joan of Arc</i> (1928) or the actor Jennifer Jones in Henry King’s <i>The Song of Bernadette</i> (1943) – both
involving highly religious, canonised female historical figures. I’ve returned
to the portrait and subjects during casting for my current project, <i>The Far South</i> (forthcoming), as these
types of portraits also echo the format of the screen test (when actors
audition for parts on-camera), an experience that is itself a threshold, but
where innocence transitions into the profane. Thus, the themes in <i>Communion</i> as a study will migrate to
secular discourses of the face, albeit with a theological framing.<a href="#_ftn35" id="_ftnref35" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Holding the poses
under the lights caused the young subject discomfort and the intense conditions
of production bearing down upon a young girl are also foregrounded by the film
shoot and point to the profane, sacrificial, oppressive, merciless and even diabolical
system of Hollywood 3-point light invented to produce allure and surface
beauty. </span></p>

my coda to Roberto Rosellini’s film <i>Little
Flowers of Saint Francis</i> (1950), which it references in the graphics.
Rosellini’s film is about Saint Francis’ band of monks. Clare, the founder of
the <i>Sorelle Povere</i> appears only once
in the film. Francis and Clare have a meeting in a field. The scene is deeply
beautiful, but I wanted to give Clare, the founder and the sisters their own
space to speak through the centuries. This is the only scene in which they
appear. The Franciscan monastery was also situated next to the new Monastery of
St. Clare in San Marino, where I filmed and stayed. Although they are
autonomous, my impression was that the Franciscans are their spiritual
directors, much as Francis was Clare’s. The Franciscan ideals of simplicity,
the Highest Poverty and work of the hands are transferred to the filmic medium
used. The Bolex camera and composition create a sense of serene stillness in
the depiction of the sisters pursuing simple crafts and household duties. </span></p>

This musicality is of course significant to your practice. In
terms of structure, your films don't have linear narratives as is commonly
understood, but instead swooping, looping or folding structures. This holds,
perhaps with some exceptions, in your feature-length work as well. How do you
go about conceptualising structure and then realising it through your editing? </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I think about the trajectory itself as the narrative and how it
builds up towards a climax or several heightened points. I thank arts producer
Gary Thomas for once writing in a letter how he thought I could command
structure to create emotional impact.<a href="#_ftn37" id="_ftnref37" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[37]</a>
That’s just it. Structure is needed to create the flow and build of emotion
which is the trajectory. The process of building a climax when there is no
storyline is like building an intensity across time while building pressure
behind and on the image, but also through the sound which can be silence or
pauses. There are also other factors like pace and rhythm. I have used chapter
structures in some films. In other films, it is a structural concept. <i>Stabat Mater</i> is structured like an
altarpiece and MARIA (2023) is like an iconostasis. I also use schemas; I need
to see them visually. There are large wall charts for <i>Temenos</i> and “<i>Now I am yours</i>”.
As seen from the earlier image at the RCA, <i>First
Memory</i> was plotted in graphs. Now I use digital templates, keeping
everything in a relational place otherwise it would be impossible to structure
and create a trajectory towards intensity.</span></p>

This intensity is also closely connected to your use of voice.

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">In <i>First Memory</i> I wanted
the single voice to be on the edge of reading/speaking in a neutral tone. I
wanted to keep out characterisation. The narration is spoken at a deliberate
pace and delivery. I wanted to convey sensuality. I wanted the closeness of the
voice to the microphone to give it a sensual intimacy and physical presence.
This was important to enunciate a female presence because the woman’s voice is
always connected to the body. I continued a measured recitation in the next
film <i>Close to Home</i> (1982-85). I drew
a clear difference between my idea of the voice not being a voice-over, which
Silverman theorises as a male dominant structure in cinema (mentioned earlier).
The woman’s voice territorialised the woman-centred work I was doing. <s></s></span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I started in 2020 and it was a slow need which built up and took
me in that direction. During the pandemic, I took vocal lessons and did some
courses online and later took night classes with different vocal teachers, </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>including one exploring the Early
Medieval plainchant of Hildegard von Bingen (with mezzo soprano and troibaritz
Maria Jonas).<a href="#_ftn38" id="_ftnref38" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I like to combine different genres of music with spoken words and
vocals. I’m not listening to the genre but to the feeling. This might lead to
unexpected combinations, for example, rock music by <i>The Doors</i> is included in MARIA, a film about opera. The Spanish
saeta in <i>Stabat Mater</i> is used in its
tight traditional form but in the next film <i>“Now
I am yours”</i> I wanted to break out of the song form – to what might be
termed ‘the voice of the film’, which are all the elements brought together. I
didn’t know what this would sound like or if it was possible. I felt that the
vocals, spoken word and any other elements should come together to form the
voice of the film. Finding the vocalist to combine with my spoken voice was a
major part. It was fantastic that Shelley Hirsch performed in <i>“Now I am yours”. </i><s></s></span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The cry and scream are also
very much in my work as the subject in extremis, from soprano to contralto.
Singers like Diamanda Galas and Sainkho Namtchylak, Nico and Maria Callas are
exciting performers because they can go to extremes. I enjoy recording with
musicians and there is an alternative version of the MARIA soundtrack,
re-interpreting the soundtrack to Pasolini’s <i>Medea</i> (1969)<i>.</i> This
version includes recordings by musicians and singers of folkloric, sacred and
ancient chant traditions.<a href="#_ftn40" id="_ftnref40" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

Like many moving image artists, at a certain point, you moved from
16mm to digital filmmaking. You’ve mentioned this transition earlier, but what
were the reasons for this? How did it make you feel about your practice and the
work itself? </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">It was a breakout point for me to mix formats in the films of the
1990s and it is the hybridity that was important. It is still a 16mm film
because <i>“Now I am yours”</i> was
telerecorded (as it was called) to analogue but the offline editing allowed a
fluidity that was very much in keeping with the ‘feminine’ register as a kind
of ‘ecriture’, following on from Cixous’ writing. </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>I use this term as way of thinking about
a form of making, which I then transpose as a ‘feminine’ register of fluidity,
plasticity and elusive instability of the materials in the construction of the
work.<a href="#_ftn42" id="_ftnref42" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[42]</a>
<span style="color:black">At each transfer of <i>“Now I am yours”</i> the images deteriorated and faded further, almost
to the ‘noise’ in the image. These offline tapes are quite beautiful now.
Offline and different formats enabled a performative plasticity, an aesthetic
surface and texture that 16mm and the Steenbeck would have been too stable and
rigid for. It allowed me to break free of the Steenbeck and its formal
constraints, which was my reach for the films that came out of that rupture. It
was the 3-machine U-matic edit suite – which crucially had a microphone – that released
the impulse of the film <i>Stabat Mater</i>.
Later it was transferred into 16mm film with all its energy captured. It had a
complicated production process going through the optical printer, although it
looks improvised and immediate, it isn’t. There is a ‘master’ film gauge set
for each film even though it might include different formats. It all has to be
integral and unified, not a collage or bricolage. <i>Temenos</i> is a 35mm film although it has other formats in it. Some
films are one gauge, <i>Communion</i> is 35mm
and <i>Sorelle Povere de Santa Chiara</i> is
photographed on16mm. These choices are part of the film. In this way, the
‘master’ gauge is the language of the film too, but it doesn’t need to be
literal. I embraced the possibility of video and digital but as a means to an
end. I did have difficulty when digital started to be called ‘film’. I know it
is all called film now, but in many ways, the interview series of which this
conversation is a part, has been about exploring that lacuna. <s></s></span></span></p>

As we’ve touched upon already, the dominant theme of your work is
devotion. This takes many forms and is complex in itself. The early films
present religious devotion, but also devotion to beauty and shared experience.
Your later work explores personal passions and loves, for individuals and arts.
Can you say more about devotion?</span></p>

  <b>Nina Danino:</b>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I don’t think of the theme of devotion per se. Experimental film
to my mind is not associated with the observance of devotion because it is a
disruptive form, and devotion suggests a meditative and attentive approach.
However, it is making me think as to whether devotion can also be expressed as
something fervent and passionate. In <i>I
Die of Sadness Crying for You</i> (2018), the performance of emotion in the
songs can be close to religious exaltation – Marifé de Triana is a
‘grandissima’. I show adulation for Maria Callas in MARIA<i> </i>and a meditative devotion to Nico in <i>Solitude</i> – thus they become icons through my film devotion. In <i>Sorelle Povere di Santa Chiara</i> (2016) I
wanted to show my devotion through attention to composition. The year before, I
made the film <i>Jennifer </i>(2015),
exploring the life of </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Jennifer
del Corazón de Jesús, a Discalced Carmelite nun.<a href="#_ftn43" id="_ftnref43" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[43]</a> It is documentary in the interview with her but structural
in the filmed interiors as</span> <span style="color:black">the static camera
creates a feminist devotional space within the monastery, especially in the
last scene, where the community are praying the Divine Office in the Oratory.
The scene was filmed by Jennifer herself – she turns the camera on and walks
into the frame she takes her place with the others and joins the prayers. I
think it becomes devotional at that point because it is a connective act
between the viewer and the community through the duration of the scene which is
long and the performance of prayers as well as Jennifer’s own inventive
devotion to the film in realising a recording of the community in their inner
sanctum, which also is a disruption because it contravened the expressed
prohibition of the community on filming them, much less in such an intimate act
of prayer. </span></span></p>

Another important aspect of your films is beauty. Your works deal
with beautiful things, but perhaps sometimes with damaging impacts – such as
promoting repressive or gender-stereotypical notions of Catholicism. How do you
incorporate things of physical beauty that simultaneously connote things from
another realm or imagination, some of which may not always be positive? </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I can’t see how beauty can be repressive unless it is the
perfection of a Chanel perfume advert or a fashion commercial – that is not
beauty. Beauty is about imperfection and disturbance, but it doesn’t fetishise
it or commodify it. I’m not sure I understand anything about beauty or its pros
and cons – I am not sure if my films deal with beautiful things. They are made
with such low budgets and so much struggle that their flaws are clear – they
are made not in the stables of luxury art nor artists’ studios of productions
for galleries and museums but in adverse conditions. They come out of struggle
and if I create something that despite all these deficits presents windows to
something that can be beautiful – well, maybe it is not beauty, it is something
else because their foundations, based on struggle, are there. The dialectic of
production is there, I think it has to be there to create something that is not
just the lure of surface luxury. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">On the other hand, there is
a lot of beauty in experimental film obviously, due to its relationship with
and dependence on, aesthetics. Gidal’s films in particular. Like other
experimental filmmakers, I am also trained in aesthetics, in painting and that
permeates experimental film. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Catholicism has strong
aesthetics also and as a discourse it enabled me to proceed into a heightened
register once I realised that I couldn’t get further in the secular models of
literary-critical analysis, continental feminism, post-structuralism and psychoanalysis
etc. I was seeking a new discourse that could take me higher so to speak.
Catholicism holds many of my sources of art, painting, music, theology, writing
and cinema. Andrew Greeley’s book <i>The
Catholic Imagination</i> (2000) argues for a Catholic consciousness being
deeply immersed in sensuality and sexuality.<a href="#_ftn44" id="_ftnref44" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[44]</a>
At the same time, Catholicism is also non-hierarchical and does not
differentiate between high and low art forms, simple hymns and sublime sacred
music, popular devotion and high Mass – kitsch doesn’t exist. It is messy and
includes cheap and precious materials. It is extravagantly iconophile, which is
very contemporary, and seeks transfiguration. It has a global spread and a
slippage of boundaries between life and art and a rhetoric of abundance.
Although, I am indebted to the style called ‘structural film’ with its
over-sparse and austere form, which has supported feminist forms, and to some
of its claims of spiritual progress,<a href="#_ftn45" id="_ftnref45" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">[45]</a>
my instinct at present is to follow a rhetoric of abundance especially via the
auto-inscriptive aspects of my practice. </span></p>

illustrative form of representation. I was constructing a female subject that
has no direct or fixed representation or resists representation and different
degrees of totalisation and thus rather than illustrate it, to bring it into
being, to adopt a use of Gidal’s terms.<a href="#_ftn46" id="_ftnref46" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

published here, myself and the other artists I have interviewed have discussed
our work through the subject/ive, which we searched for in our filmmaking. The
subject isn’t something unified and easy to locate, it is always dispersed and
deconstructed, so I think of the subject not as myself, but as an enunciation
that comes into being from the film. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Self-inscription to me has to do with being in the place of
speaking of film, there being no individuation in this enunciation, it is a
being at one with the film, of enfolding, of putting yourself in a place, in
the place of the film’s enunciation. Becoming film. The camera disappears and
there is no observer anymore, but this is the filmic jouissance produced
through this process. It replicates or perhaps is itself, a mystical state, it
is both undifferentiated and theorised. That’s how I felt making the films.
Only the films in the <i>Religious Trilogy</i>
perform this mode of self-inscription in my work. I can perform it again, but I
didn’t want to repeat it and thus reduce it to a style. When the right film
comes, I will use this visual language again. I think self-inscription is
something particular and specific and it is not possible with an objective or
positional camera. </span></p>

Baroque</i> are published in the <i>Religious
Trilogy: Rupture, Rapture, Jouissance</i> DVD, following an impulse to
jouissance, trance, transport and psychedelia, where the borders of your body
disperse, in this case, in film. It is done through the materials themselves;
editing, voice, image, camera, what is recited or narrated – song, location,
light, view, pace, rhythm etc. It all has to be confluent and intersect in the
right way. If one of these is out of enunciative alignment, the structure
collapses and inscription doesn’t happen. But it comes together in the Trilogy,

expanded textual production. That I am, as an artist, enmeshed in this expanded
network, in photographs, readings, the choice of texts, the personal pronoun. I
am enfolded and networked as part of the textual materials. I talk about the
film and the fold and this enfolding in Susanna Pool’s <i>The Touching Camera</i> documentary (1998) and in “<i>Now I am yours</i>”, as well as the essay ‘Film, The Body, The Fold’,

believe I was ever trying to create or find a personal identity through my
work. I consider identity to be the thing you have to get rid of, thus undoing
yourself through avant-garde art. I think it’s the thing that makes something
not be avant-garde if I can put it like that. In <i>“Now I am yours”</i> I am mapping myself to St. Teresa as a
construction – both of us. The films are part of me, and I am part of them but
making films has been a way to find out about film not to find out about
myself. The fluid identity that I have created for myself in the
self-inscriptive films is not burdensome, on the contrary, it has been
self-liberating through the surplus created by the performance of expression. I
have increased rather than minimised my presence, so I am probably thinking
that more self-inscription is necessary. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Only very few films that have left such a significant impression
on me, and I want to include them in my work. The footage from <i>Teresa de Jesus</i> by Juan de Orduña (1961)
is from a generic biopic on St. Teresa and is in my film. In Orduña’s version
she is seen in certain dramatic actions personified by an actor, so the film is
not charged in the same way. Barthes uses the term <i>studium </i>for what is legible study through standardisation.<a href="#_ftn48" id="_ftnref48" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">In the case of iconic
cinema, film rights owners have to approve the presence of these scenes and be
sent the film at a near-final stage. It is something very big for my film
because these films are cinema icons, and they are not being used as clips in a
documentary to illustrate but as art in art and they also become part of my
film.<s></s></span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">It’s the medium of time that I love. To set out ideas and to
measure, to create a reflexive experience of viewing in some films is
important. Time is scale and in <i>Temenos</i>
I wanted to work on a larger scale and in a slower time after the fast
self-inscription films. I’ve mentioned how the use of real-time in <i>Jennifer</i> creates devotional space and
also is an act of trust. It enables the viewer to join them in their real
devotional time, to be in their duration as an act of community-building with
them. In this way, real time can open routes to a woman-centred and even
feminist duration. In <i>I Die</i> <i>of Sadness Crying For You</i>, time is
needed to perform the song in full – this is the creation of feminist space,
which is being claimed and it is needed also to convey the full emotion of the
performance and thus also honour the central performers, Spanish singer Marifé
de Triana and my mother. Thus, these decisions make a film longer. Also the
feature length is an industry form which is male director dominated and there’s
something relevant about that too in using this form in films that are marginal
to this and woman-centred. </span></p>

centre of <i>Temenos</i>. In this film,
listening is enhanced by insignificant sounds, quietness, the rustle of a tree,
the sound of a bee, and small things which disturb outward normality. The film
depicts the cycle of the seasons. There is a slowing down of our senses and this
enhances and clears the frame for something else to appear. All these elements
are creating the world of <i>Temenos</i> as

Houwa (as we titled this track). The woman is like a Dolorosa or ‘woman of
sorrows’ at the foot of the cross and also an archetype of the grieving woman,
found all around the Mediterranean. It was a manifestation in itself to find
her there. I found manifestations in all the landscapes of <i>Temenos</i>, a film in which the landscape is haunted. </span></p>

investigate anything. It was pure allure. I know you have to couch it to
funding bodies with research questions and social outcomes but in reality, I
was just drawn to Maria Callas as a talismanic figure, to her talent, beauty
and work ethic. Her glamour and all these things pulled me towards her like a
lodestar. She also has a similar metallic quality of speaking voice to my
mother. Then once in her orbit, of course, I read and studied and listened, but
I didn’t start with the idea of making an objective study or investigation. I
operate more or less intuitively through the drives and in fact, ‘Piercings’
(referring to the piercing cry and scream) was the original film title for the
film in an early treatment written in 2009, which was intended to be an expressionistic
flow resembling <i>“Now I am yours”</i>. I
don’t have underlying questions or themes that I want to tackle in my films.

are well known performances, they circulate in many documentaries.The difference is that I used fragments of
this archive to transform them. What is unique is the spoken transcript which I
recite in a long monologue in my film. To transform the footage I used optical
techniques that relate back to the optical printer and workshop facilities at
the LFMC, intercutting negative and positive, solarisation, superimposition,
the use of colour filters, re-framing, open scan framing and slow motion. I
wanted to return to the orbit of the LFMC using these now classic experimental techniques
as they have become. I felt that these would be the route to Maria’s
transfiguration. The technique has a purpose, and I had to wait for the right
film to use them (I didn’t need to use them in my other films). These
techniques forge transfigurations from existing archive images of Callas. The
intercutting, flashing and strobing, the flicker of Tosca enhances the demonic
aspect of the stabbing and Callas’ rage. The technique of the flicker refers to
other experimental films such as Kurt Kren’s <i>White/Black</i> (1968) and its violent optical, shattering and
energising effect. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The filming techniques used
for the Paris footage, which was shot on 16mm, were inspired by Stan Brakhage’s
<i>The Dead</i> (1960), which he also filmed
in Père Lachaise and on the Seine. There are shots of Kenneth Anger in a café
in flashing images, with fast intercutting of black-and-white negative and
positive. Through <i>The Dead,</i> I was
able enter the gates of the cemetery of Père Lachaise physically and filmically
– MARIA is, in this sense, a classical experimental film. <s></s></span></p>

As you say, the film ends in Père Lachaise cemetery, and we hear a

transfiguration. Extraordinary women are castigated by Hollywood and by all
systems of representation. Jim Morrison’s exhortation to self-transformation in
the song lyrics – “I’m a changeling, see me change” – is a triumphant call to a
life force. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">What is transfiguration? The Transfiguration is to become radiant
in glory. The panels in MARIA<i> </i>are
hypnotic and mesmerising. To be transfigured means to shine with inner light.
When I saw MARIA shown at Opera North, Leeds in a large cinema, I was shaking,
perhaps because it was the first screening.<a href="#_ftn50" id="_ftnref50" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[50]</a>
I thought, yes Callas is transfigured. As an icon, she is presented in a filmic
iconostasis, which is the panel of paintings that separates the altar from the
nave in an Orthodox church. In Greek Orthodox theology they are windows to the
heavenly. She is transfigured in each of the panels using experimental
techniques. Callas slowly changes before our eyes from a woman, a secular icon,
to a transfigured and glorified icon and back to a woman, screaming as the
ancient Medea. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">These transfigurations have
to emerge from the process or decisions relevant to the image and the
techniques and thus not be a gimmick or an effect. Again, the poet Coleridge is
of guidance to me, as this process relates to the transformative power of the
imagination. Hyperbole according to Coleridge would rely on ready association,
what he calls the ‘Fancy’, and this can disfigure rather than transfigure and
literalise rather than transcend. </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>He
writes, “FANCY, on the contrary, has no other counters to play with, but
fixities and definites. The Fancy is indeed no other than a mode of Memory
emancipated from the order of time and space; and blended with, and modified by
that empirical phenomenon of the will, which we express by the word CHOICE. But
equally with the ordinary memory it must receive all its materials ready made
from the law of association”.<a href="#_ftn51" id="_ftnref51" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[51]</a> Transfiguration must emerge from the material itself,
which is the source of the imagination. </span></span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Both MARIA<i> </i>and <i>Solitude </i>are about the subject in
extremis. The structure of MARIA is that of an iconostasis made up of panels as
stated. <i>Solitude</i> is a reflection in
the realm of a dark mirror in the gloom of <i>The
Palace of Art</i>, which is about the muse’s solitude, downfall and despair at
the aridity of art.<a href="#_ftn52" id="_ftnref52" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

Both together form a diptych through the invitation to intensities of
self-reflection to the viewer of the screen as a portal and an impenetrable
surface of the image. This can lead to variations of meditation, contemplation
and the edges of transcendence, especially with the wonderful music of Ash Ra
Temple and Gagarin. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Gagarin, legendary musician Graham Dowdall, was a member of Nico’s
post-punk, <i>The Faction</i> in the 1980s.
We collaborated and he arranged the music for three of the Nico songs in the
film soundtrack. He had played them many times and wanted to do them in a new
way. The soundtrack also includes the music of Ash Ra Tempel and guitarist
James Creed and my recital of poetry. <i>Solitude
</i>was launched at the London Short Film Festival programmed by Philip Ilson
as a live music event in January 2023 where Gagarin, performed live electronic
music.<a href="#_ftn53" id="_ftnref53" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[53]</a>
The launch screening at Rich Mix was a unique and unforgettable event,
fortunately, I have a recording of it. The live music performance created a new
electronic ambient ethereal layer to the film. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Graham Dowdall
added immeasurably to the film because it came from an authentic place. He was
due to do a live performance with the film in June at Cultplex in Manchester
but sadly he was not able to. I feel honoured and privileged to have worked
with him and to have his exquisite music in the film. He said <i>Solitude</i> was a true portrait of Nico
because she was unknowable and a mystery and in the film she is unknowable, a
screen and a surface. Given that his life has ended and that he is such a big
part of <i>Solitude </i>I feel that <i>Solitude</i> is also a memorial to him as an
artist as well as a portrait of Nico but of course. He is a legendary musician
and the legacy of his music is celebrated beyond the film, in wide networks.<a href="#_ftn54" id="_ftnref54" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Most of my films have been funded by Arts Council England (ACE)

The <span>British Film Institute
(BFI), CICV (Centre international de création video), Montbéliard-Belfort,

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I do recall the nineties as a time when artists began to show
moving images in the gallery. I think the experimental film didn’t transition;
it wouldn’t be an experimental film if it had. It has stayed in its
philosophical paradigm although the culture, the technical infrastructure
around it and the artists’ movement around it dispersed and disappeared. That
has been interesting, to be part of something that has become historical as an
artists’ movement. It happens to every art movement; some have lasted longer
than others but individual artists continue. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">In the 1990s <i>“Now I am yours” </i>was shown in several
large group shows by upcoming YBA (Young British Artist) curators and
gallerists. At the time I thought, I never want to show it in this way again. I
didn’t attempt to show my films in the gallery again. I felt that my films till
then were for cinema, and I just accepted that. The Experimenta section in LFF
was therefore important as one of the few remaining showcases for experimental
and long-form films. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">In the years between making <i>“Now I am yours”</i> and <i>Communion, </i>spanning from 1993 to 2000, I
showed <i>“Now I am yours” </i>at festivals
widely and also presented it at conferences. University lecture theatres are
well equipped and the audience attentive, but academics had limited knowledge
of experimental film and it did feel as if there was a patronising attitude to
artists' film. I had a film retrospective at Close-up Cinema Centre in 2016.<a href="#_ftn55" id="_ftnref55" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

I think my audiences now might come from social media and platforms, interviews
online and so on. I recently participated in the conference <i>Gesture</i>, which framed itself as a
three-day investigation, and it was very different.<a href="#_ftn56" id="_ftnref56" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

I felt that that gap had closed. Scholars are much more aware and versed in
visual art now and in histories of film, as is the public.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">By the 2000s artist’s cinema
was showing in installations in biennale exhibitions, museums, commercial
galleries, art fairs and in site-specific public art spaces and projects. I had
a gallery in Madrid for some years with Magda Bellotti and showed work in
PhotoEspaña. From 2010 to 2018 <i>Communion,
Sorelle Povere di Santa Chiara </i>and<i>
Close to Home</i> were shown as film installations in different buildings and
locations. However, large film installations need substantial technical,
curatorial and institutional support and are only possible, I felt, when
working with museums. Nevertheless, it was exciting curating film and
time-based work and to expand my work from single screen which I hadn’t done
since <i>First Memory</i> (1981) for the
architectural spaces, churches or locations in which they were shown.<a href="#_ftn57" id="_ftnref57" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I’m much more engaged with
the curatorialimportance of how each
film is contextualised. <i>Sorelle Povere di
Santa Chiara</i> was recently shown in a research-based group show on craft,
sewing and women’s collectives. I liked this very much for the film, which is
about a religious community of women, and for the film to be shown in the
context of women’s collectives.<a href="#_ftn58" id="_ftnref58" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I’ve always written on my work, ever since <i>First Memory</i> (as mentioned at the start)<i>. </i>Each of my films includes writing and as well as librettos,
notes, scripts. Some essays have been published, and many others are
unpublished. Writing was a big part of experimental film practice, which
includes artists’ writing on their work and about each other and on film
theory, this was also a big part of the LFMC. At that time only Jean Matthee
wrote about my work, I don’t recall any other writing.<a href="#_ftn59" id="_ftnref59" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

reflection and personal expression is not really for historical peer review or

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">As Adrian Rifkin the art

[60]</a>
Rather than the other way around. I enjoy writing when in a creative mode,
towards creating a film or in response to a film rather than for interpretive
or explanatory purposes. I love writing of this kind – it’s like a love letter
to a film that is still to be made or after it is made. I like writing for
itself. I tried an expressive style for the first time in a screening of <i>Stabat Mater</i>, which was presented to an
international delegation of James Joyce scholars, but they did not respond at
all, only by silence.<a href="#_ftn61" id="_ftnref61" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Feminism is still significant and being developed in new ways as a
critical discourse. </span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>I
don’t have a sense of a cohesive contemporary women’s moving image culture or
movement but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t one. In recent years I’ve been
supervising a PhD by M. Maria Walhaut <span style="color:black">at Goldsmiths </span>on
‘Indecent/ing tongues’, examining<span style="color:black"> trans glossolalia.
The significant gender debates today have moved towards trans creative
practices, particularly where it crosses into visual arts, music and performing
arts, evident in the work of musicians and artists Anohni, Ethel Cain, Laura
Jane Grace and Keith/Mina Caputo who is de-transitioning. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">There are also active
practices of contemporary feminism in novel writing and poetic writing. The
journal SALT.magazine founded by the BA Fine Art at Goldsmiths, follows an <i>Undercut </i>model as an artists’ run
collective. It’s published by Montez Press, whose output has a ‘focus on queer
and intersectional feminist practices through the lens of artists’ writing’.<a href="#_ftn62" id="_ftnref62" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">

There seem to be many connective and discursive artists’ run initiatives
happening now, which was what I was excited by at the LFMC. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">
After an intense period in which you delivered two feature length
films, you have diversified your practice in some quite radical ways. Could you
tell us about the reasons behind this change? What other practices and themes
have inspired you recently and enabled you to make this shift? </span></p>

  <b>Nina Danino:</b>
  </p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I have made two long films in three years so doing more immediate
work alongside it feels like a release. Releasing myself, de-professionalising
myself, using non-professional tools such as a mobile phone, good quality but
small Zoom recorder and publicly accessible platforms of distribution. Zoom,
Soundcloud, YouTube, Bandcamp, Vimeo and social media are liberating in this
context. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The seminal American
performance artist Linda Mary Montano and her art/life practice have been an
inspiration through her self-liberating and de-institutionalising practice.<a href="#_ftn63" id="_ftnref63" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[63]</a>
She puts work on YouTube, which is truly remarkable for an established artist.
It has made me more outgoing with my work and not worry too much if it’s not
perfect and provisional even though it is taking a risk. I’ve started to share
work and experiments in this way recently too. I rehearse and record in
churches locally in London and Gibraltar, which I have done over the last four
years. The last piece I made was a one-take revisiting of the album <i>Bare Wires </i>(1968) by John Mayall upon
his death. The vinyl album, which I still have, is part of the piece.<a href="#_ftn64" id="_ftnref64" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[64]</a>
</span><span style='font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>There are other song-based<span style="color:black"> performances that involve me re-interpreting tracks, such
my performance of <i>I’m Dying</i> by Yoko
Ono (1995) (pictured below) or a version of <i>‘<span>Light: Look at Your Sun’ </span></i><span>(1972)<i> </i>by Ash Ra Tempel</span>.<a href="#_ftn65" id="_ftnref65" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[65]</a>
I also make performance dance videos on the boundaries of private and public
practice – as discussed in a talk I gave a few years ago called ‘Rollin’ and
Tumblin’ ’<i> </i>(2023)<a href="#_ftn66" id="_ftnref66" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[66]</a>
– and I have recently released an album titled <i>I looked at the earth and it was formless and empty</i> <i>TESTAMENT</i> in October 2024, which came
about as a collaborative project, </span>with <span style="color:black">electronic instrumentation by Pablo
Zapata (who also did the recording and engineering </span>in London between
April and June 2024). It f<span style="color:black">eatures Biblical readings and improvised vocals, the tracks were
performed live and improvised takes were used without editing, hence flaws are
left in.</span><a href="#_ftn67" id="_ftnref67" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[67]</a>I have always worked as a solo artist and collaboration is
a way to de-create yourself. I felt this when I did a collaborative
intervention for a piece by Donna Matthews.<a href="#_ftn68" id="_ftnref68" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[68]</a>It’s a way of opening your
practice. It’s also nice if someone asks you to collaborate or participate in
their project or to contribute to it. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">Perhaps self-inscription at
present is through music and performance. I’m just following without a goal; my
work does not necessarily have a direction – it’s rhizomic.<a href="#_ftn69" id="_ftnref69" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color:  #0000FF;">
[69]</a>
I think the no-goal aspect is the part of jouissance that doesn’t have an
objective social or commentary purpose. I am performing the Lacanian
exhortation or call for more, more, encore and intoxications. I am in this
ballpark and am going with it as far as it wants to go as part of the process
of de-creation as a practice of jouissance in de-selving and self-realisation.
At the moment the voice is giving me a sense of the possibility of
self-realisation and enjoyment. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The LFMC was all about
artists’ self-empowerment and this is still important to carry within me. One
needs to work out how you can give yourself agency as an artist. In a way,
music is my medium of intoxication at present and I am with my back to the Rock
of Gibraltar looking out to the beyond of the Straits. I can’t see beyond the
horizon, but I feel the jouissance and waves of music reach me, and it feels
good. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">As I mentioned earlier, it is a series set in Andalusia currently
entitled <i>The Straits Trilogy</i>. It goes
back to literature. I’m interested in short story film adaptation, the film
adaptation of the novel and the existential film journey. It is about love and
lovers, the malady of love, about sorrow and grief because of love. </span></p>

  <b>Nina Danino:</b>
  </p>

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">No. I want to make <i>The
Straits Trilogy</i> as I mentioned earlier and within it, <i>The Far South</i> about geography, literature and a gathering of many
of the themes here and also going in new directions such as casting and
dialogue.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">I have a vision and sense of each film I have made very strongly
before it is made. I can see it all. Although it seems insurmountable that they
could ever exist and be realised, they do get made in the way that I envision
them – but they also already exist. Only one film hasn’t been like that. This
sounds mystical or mystificatory. They come into existence through a struggle
because the funding is difficult to achieve but everything else happens as it
should. Also important creative collaborators in music and in every
department.l feel that I am bringing
into existence what already exists and has to be made. A film can be there
years before it is time to make it. MARIA, <i>I
Die of Sadness Crying For You</i> and <i>Jennifer</i>
existed in my gestalt of them, seven to nine years before it was time to
realise them. <i>The Far South</i> has been
there for ten years already, the angel is on the beach waiting. I feel taken
aback that I could have realised such a presence as a film, which is now
separate and autonomous, it is a mystery. </p>

Centre was an amalgamation of two important collections of work, that of the

London Video Arts/Access), and provided access to making and screening
facilities, in line with the ethos of these constituent organisations. The Lux
Centre went bankrupt and closed suddenly in 2002, when the distribution
collection of works (due to the fact it was still owned by the different
artists who made them) went on to form the basis for LUX, London’s distribution
catalogue. For accounts of the closure of the Lux Centre and establishment of

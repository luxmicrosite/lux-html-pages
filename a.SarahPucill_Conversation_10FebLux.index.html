They later revisited their discussion in 2024. &nbsp;Sarah Pucill was very supportive of this project from the outset and as a reader of the manuscript and the Introduction text. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Nina Danino and Sarah Pucill have had a strong working relationship for a number of years. In 2007, Sarah Pucill curated the programme </span><span class="c3">The Subjective Camera</span><span>&nbsp;(2007), which included work by Nina Danino along with other artists who have taken part in this series of conversations.</span><sup class="c5"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;They both also took part in a Roundtable on &lsquo;Women&rsquo;s Experimental Film at the LFMC&rsquo; in 2015.</span><sup class="c5"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;They met in the early 1990s through the filmmaker Sandra Lahire, who along with Nina Danino was awarded an Arts Council of England/Channel 4 Experimenta commission. In this conversation, Sarah Pucill discusses the context around artist&rsquo;s moving image and experimental practices of the 1990s and now. She outlines how her work engages with the relationship between women, the possibility of a language other to the phallocentric and considers the centrality of the female subject as well as the use of female artistic references in her work. Towards this aim, she talks about the importance of staging in her films, the role of photography, the use of </span><span class="c3">mise-en-scene</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;ansd camera framing, discussing the roles she and others play as performer s in these works. The material creation of decorative tableaux vivants with performers, objects, props and fabrics, which use the visual language of the film set, the craft of set design and which strongly reference theatre. There a sense of the craft and skill involved with using16mm to achieve the visual stagings in her films, mostly set in interiors. The filmmaker&rsquo;s self-reflection and notion of selves is presented through these stagings. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c1">The discussion also considers how Sarah Pucill&rsquo;s work is informed by three decades of study and engagement with film, feminist and visual theory. This critical knowledge and questioning informs the conversation, conducted in her home in July 2019. They work through the lesbian gaze and, particularly, the use of mirror in her films, which is symbolic &ndash; a reflecting object, a metaphor for the idea of multiple selves. A metaphor that is also a strong thread in her process of production and making the films. It is integral to her visual language using objects, materials, props and her unique way of achieving this as an experimental, a single/singular, filmmaker. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">________________</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">This conversation is one of a series of six discussions undertaken by the filmmaker Nina Danino in 2020.

I had previously been working between sculpture and painting. I was painting with sand and I was working across distorted images of my face, then it moved from 2D to 3D, into a photograph and then after that photograph I wanted to make a film. I continued to ask questions about what the self-portrait was, about what that is between </span><span class="c3 c4">You Be Mother</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">Milk and Glass</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1993). I was interested in something between the interior and the exterior, so the self-portrait is a fa&ccedil;ade. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">I think my first film </span><span class="c3 c4">You Be Mother</span><span class="c1">, looking back now, determined much of the exploration that I continued with in nearly four decades and even now. In fact, it&#39;s a challenging of the ideal of self-portraiture &ndash; the idea of anything that can be a self-portrait. It&rsquo;s not replacing one thing with another, rather it&#39;s much more a concept of thinking about the split and multiple self &ndash; is it image, is it object, is it voice, is it the veneer, is it the inside or the outside? It&rsquo;s a whole set of relations of self and the world where others and the inanimate are part of that and this is very much there in my first film. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c26"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 646.01px; height: 363.40px;"><img alt="A hand holding a picture of a person crying

There is the use of projection and of framing and reframing, images of yourself and in </span><span class="c3">Stages of Mourning</span><span>&nbsp;(2004) you are seen with a set of photographs, as they are scattered on the floor and you lie down on them. They are also pinned on walls in a bedroom and you pose in front of them. How did you engage with the concept of the feminist need of saying &ldquo;I&rdquo;? </span><span class="c4">Was it that concept that </span><span>made you decide to start using y</span><span class="c16">our </span><span class="c1">own image and staging yourself for the camera, to use yourself in front of the camera not rather than but as well as taking the role of a director behind the camera? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">I was very influenced by the work of filmmakers and artists like Chantal Akerman, Maya Deren, Claude Cahun, Francesca Woodman, Cindy Sherman between photography and film, also even Barbara Hammer, Jayne Parker, Sandra Lahire. Feminist and many queer feminists who were particularly interested in this in the 1990s, to particularly explore what it is to be in front and behind the camera. Obviously as we know from the feminist theory that was raging and very active during the nineties, this concept of being both object within a frame and at the same time the author who frames, edits and lights that body, really challenges the way in which we understand the mainstream language of film, where the female is objectified and &ldquo;over there&rdquo;. Instead, the female has agency and is authoring herself &ndash; that is important. But, just as important is to dislocate the idea of the individual as separate, the idea of an identity that is stable, defined and not connected with and part of, others and the world. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Could you talk about your work in relation to the self-portrait? &nbsp;I see the construction of your films as a questioning of the self-portrait where the portrait of the performer to camera is always in question. A performer who poses, dons disguises, costumes, dresses up is a practice which seems to come from theatre. &nbsp;In her essay on your work </span><span>&lsquo;Between Mirrors&rsquo;, Helena Reckitt also draws attention to the curtain in your films.</span><sup class="c5"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The curtain opens to the stage, are you a master of ceremonies as the director as well as a performer? </span><span class="c4">There is also the aspect of disguise. The wig appears in your films worn by yourself and performers and in </span><span class="c3 c4">Swollen Stigma</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1998), </span><span class="c3 c4">Cast</span><span class="c16 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">(2000)</span><span class="c4 c16">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">and </span><span class="c3 c4">Phantom Rhapsody</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(2010), you use masks and self-masking. Also, there is a recurring figure of the doll which seems to have a central role in the theatre of your film world. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Yes, the process of thinking about the self is to be invented, to be reinvented, to be constantly in flux &ndash; that was very much there. My work on the French photographer and artist Claude Cahun speaks to this and with this, but it&rsquo;s there earlier also, in the film before </span><span class="c3 c4">Phantom Rhapsody</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&ndash; which is called </span><span class="c3 c4">Fall in Frame</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(2009) &ndash; but it&#39;s there all the time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">There are many props and objects in the films, one of the most predominant is the mirror. Does that relate to the idea of the presentation of multiple selves? &nbsp;The reflection is fragmented, at angles, the mirror can set up infinite space, a </span><span class="c3 c4">mise en abyme</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in some passages of films, reflect the camera back to the audience. The reflected and filmed pictorial space is interchangeable. &nbsp;Is this mirror related to the surrealist mirror or to the later mirror of Lacan, whose work you have said was an influence on your films?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 632.59px; height: 777.18px;"><img src="https://luxmicrosite.github.io/lux-html-pages/image2.jpg" alt="Image"> style="width: 632.59px; height: 777.18px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c4">Sarah Pucill, </span><span class="c3 c4">Phantom Rhapsody</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(2010). </span><span>Copyright: Sarah Pucill.

One is a reflexive modernist language that comes out of structuralist film for example some of Guy Sherwin&rsquo;s films that incorporate use of mirrors or the work of Conceptual artists such as Dan Graham. It&rsquo;s a meditation on what the camera is, because a camera is a mirror, inside the camera there is a mirror. Photography and film are reproductions of mirrors, it&rsquo;s about the square frame. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c4">At the same time, it comes from something else. It comes from my upbringing. When did I first encounter a mirror? My sister and I were given mirrors to put on a chest of drawers in our bedroom and my two brothers weren&#39;t. This for me is so important, there is a different relationship. Why did I have this, why didn&rsquo;t they? Why was it so central, so unspoken of? I wanted to assert this question of difference. This intensity of self-image, particularly the face for women, is really core, and something I really wanted to interrupt. I remember, as a child my mother would sit in front of the mirror and be there for a long time before she would leave the house. I&rsquo;m only thinking about this now.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">I remember being frustrated that I couldn&rsquo;t get out of the house because my mother was still there in front of the mirror. There is an intensity that I want to speak of. That we don&#39;t speak of. There is no language and I wanted to interrupt that whilst masculine modernist reflexive practices were doing something else with mirrors, like Dan Graham&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3 c4">Performer/Audience/Mirror </span><span class="c4">(1975) a performance which I love, but I wanted to throw in gender.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c4">Taking My Skin</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(2006) depicts a relationship between yourself and your mother and the mirror. The camera also part mediates the relationship. You hand the mirror to each other. She&#39;s reflecting you and then you take over and then you reflect her.

I think that performers often take a role and become a surrogate for myself. This is so much so, that for example in </span><span class="c3 c4">Magic Mirror</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(2013) I was writing about what I&rsquo;d been doing in the film and I forgot that it wasn&#39;t actually me performing but somebody else [laughing]. So, yes, it is a strong identification. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Another reflection is of the figure of a female Narcissus from the Greek myth of narcissus who falls in love with his own reflection. It appears in </span><span class="c3 c4">Swollen Stigma</span><span class="c16 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">(1998), which feels like a signature film of yours and at a time when there was experimentation with narrative in experimental film and women&rsquo;s film in particular from filmmakers like Lis Rhodes, Jayne Parker. There is a scene in </span><span class="c3 c4">Swollen Stigma</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">where the face of this female Narcissus is lying down by the pool spilling a milky liquid into the water and it&rsquo;s deep night. The sound is not naturalistic. We hear sounds of scraping, thuds, scrunching which are amplified and are not connected to the image but they create a psychological connection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Yes, it&#39;s interesting that you&#39;re picking up something that I think is a really important image and it&#39;s nice to hear that you&#39;re putting it together with that scene in </span><span class="c3 c4">Swollen Stigma</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that I had forgotten about. In </span><span class="c3 c4">Swollen Stigma</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the image of Narcissus brings together what I&rsquo;m trying to do in terms of a different sexual gaze: that&#39;s what that film is really wanting to explore. The milk coming out and going into the water is to consider something umbilical &ndash; nothing is about certainties or fixities actually but an imaginary. I was trying to explore lesbian imaginary which is key, and it is there in Cahun&rsquo;s images and it is there in her text. I put them together in both films </span><span class="c3 c4">Confessions to the Mirror</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">Magic Mirror</span><span class="c4">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Can you say more about a lesbian imaginary? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Yes, I made the film </span><span class="c3 c4">Cast</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in 2000, inspired by two images by Claude Cahun. One of herself looking in the mirror looking at the camera and one of her partner Marcel Moore looking at the camera. I made a whole film out of that in the film, a theme of moving through a mirror, of the lesbian kiss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">In </span><span class="c3 c4">Cast</span><span class="c4">, I was referencing the film </span><span class="c3 c4">Meshes of the Afternoon</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1943) by Maya Deren, and </span><span class="c3 c4">The Blood of a Poet</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1932) by Jean Cocteau: taking the theme of moving through a mirror and the lesbian kiss. It has a feminist context. What we see in </span><span class="c3 c4">Meshes, </span><span class="c4">when Deren moves through a mirror [&hellip;] for her, it&rsquo;s a death. In </span><span class="c3 c4">The Blood of a Poet</span><span class="c4">, the same movement through a mirror reflection is a gay man&rsquo;s intimate encounter. In my film, it&#39;s a female queer encounter. It was very important. At the end of </span><span class="c3 c4">Cast</span><span class="c4">, there are feet on soft sand, after the first lesbian kiss. This sequence &nbsp;shows images from Cahun&rsquo;s writing in </span><span class="c3 c4">Disavowals </span><span class="c4">(1930): &lsquo;</span><span>More easily than I would have thought possible and without leaving a trace, I pass my fist through the window.

In </span><span class="c3 c4">Mrs Dalloway</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Virginia Woolf described the match in the crocus, which I illustrate in </span><span class="c3 c4">Swollen Stigma</span><span class="c4">,</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;but bare feet on soft sand came from something of a lesbian experience, women have softer skin. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Phantom Rhapsody</span><span>&nbsp;seems to reference early cinema and the studio of early cinema pioneer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s</span><span class="c34">.

There is a woman who is the protagonist who sits in an armchair in a semi-lit living room interior. &nbsp; There is a body hanging upside down, objects appear and disappear, close ups of the protagonist pulling at her eyelashes. The domestic interior &ndash; it could be set in the filmmaker&rsquo;s home/studio. </span><span>This is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;itself intense. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span>The home as setting for experimental films has a history in women&rsquo;s filmmaking probably starting with Maya Deren who filmed </span><span class="c3">Meshes of the Afternoon</span><span>&nbsp;(1948) in her Hollywood home. &nbsp;But </span><span class="c4">also it implies a non-division of labour between home and work nor hours divided into leisure and work but everything is work and un-demarcated. &nbsp; </span><span>Working from home in terms of filmmaking suggests </span><span class="c4">an autonomous world where you have control of the production. &nbsp;This can be the attraction of experimental films to women. </span><span>&nbsp;In the filmmakers&rsquo; home as studio, we lose a sense of time and connection with the outside world</span><span class="c4">. It can also imply isolation. One of the freedoms of experimental film is that it can cut itself off from the world and re-organise space and time as does </span><span class="c3 c4">Meshes of the Afternoon </span><span class="c4">famously. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c4">Experimental film simply, because of the way in which it can control time and cut itself off from the world can both be anachronistic or asynchronous with the fetish of the &lsquo;contemporary&rsquo;. Is this a liberation for women filmmakers? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">I think it is liberatory, thinking about film as a medium, and as a capsule in time. I remember seeing the films at the London Film-makers&rsquo; Co-operative [LFMC] as being from another place, from another time, that were both important to me. The crossing of time and place is a great thing. I wrote recently about how the approach taken by artist Isaac Julien in </span><span class="c3 c4">Looking for Langston</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1989) was an influence on the work that Sandra Lahire did with Sylvia Plath.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;It has been an influence for me on the work I&rsquo;ve done with Claude Cahun. I remember Issac Julien saying that as a Black gay man in London in the eighties, there was no enabling reference for him, nor was there anything around the London Film Co-op [LFMC], which was really relevant. He took another time period, 1920s New York, and connected to the Black gay scene surrounding the gay African American poet Langston Hughes. It was closer to him and that&rsquo;s what he needed to do &ndash; to travel in time and place.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c1">I think that the emphasis on the need for the contemporary obviously comes out of capitalist culture. I was interested to loosen myself from that through thinking about co-authorship, not even thinking about the new but about a piece of work as an interpretation of an earlier artist&rsquo;s work, letting go of that sense of authorship to some degree. The emphasis on the new and the new author is quite hysterical really because the new work is not necessarily historicised. So, this emphasis on the new, if you don&#39;t look to history, actually it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">You shoot all your films on analogue what is your affinity with the photographic craft of film and the aesthetics derived from 16mm film? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">I&rsquo;ve always to-date made films on 16mm. It has informed how I think, especially having edited on 16mm with sound and image initially. I think understanding the technique can be an important part of a film. The filmmaking has always been for me not just of what I&#39;m filming or how I want it to be seen at the end, but the process of putting the film in a camera, setting up the frame, putting the shots together, thinking about sound, this is the film. The language of framing, what I juxtapose with what, is the film. The fact that you don&#39;t see it when you film, you have to wait until it comes back. The fact that expensive you have to wait for funding and you have to value what you&#39;ve shot and find a way to work with it. This process is very different and it has been very difficult for me to adjust to the digital. It&#39;s about valuing the slowness of it and the time that you give it, it impacts on what you do and the process. It is getting to the point that everything is in conjunction with digital, since making </span><span class="c3 c4">Stages of Mourning</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in 2004 I have shot on film and edited on computer. I think what I have been wanting to do is enjoy the materiality. Even since before I was making film, I was making sculpture, I was making painting, I was making objects. That continued through to where I think my filmmaking involves as much what I do with the set as what I do with a camera, where I&#39;m exploring the relationship between what happens in front of the camera and what happens behind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">You also make all the props and objects for the films. Is the handmade important and what does it mean to you to make the props yourself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Well, I sometimes make the props, I also recycle or find props. In the last two Cahun films this element has comes to the fore. I think the handmade or hand sought is important, because I also recycle and find props too, they are improvised, they are not so finely done. They don&rsquo;t get tidied with craft, there is this constant interrelationship which actually becomes chaotic. There are moments of very fine details which are attended to and moments where there is actually chaos in the improvisational element of making them in my own home. It&rsquo;s actually a small space. The limitation of what&#39;s possible is always rubbing up against what I can do because I&#39;m doing everything. I&#39;m interested in that relationship of being in different roles and having some assistance, but also taking authorial control, so having control and losing control &ndash; something about the in-between of that, is what I&rsquo;m interested in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">But it is more than producing. &nbsp;The subject/ive: it is not just about making &ndash; making is only a start. </span><span>But it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is intrinsic to your engagement with the process that you make these things yourself and therefore this is also your personal investment. &nbsp;Would you delegate it? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">It&#39;s the improvisational which is the inventiveness. If I hand it to somebody else &ndash; in the same way that if I hand the camera to someone or the edit &ndash; I&rsquo;m going to get something back that is standardised. It&#39;s going to be the same as an advert because the whole of production is standardised. If I hand it to somebody and say make me all of those, then they come back all produced. I&#39;m interested in what isn&rsquo;t standardised. It&rsquo;s not about a craft but it&rsquo;s about improvising through something that&rsquo;s inventive and playful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">In this film Confessions to the Mirror (2016), are you more in the role of director? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c16 c4 c31"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">No, I still did everything myself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">The film set of </span><span class="c3 c4">Confessions</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;combines real objects with projections of other objects.

One is a glass urn and inside it are some tiny decapitated dolls&rsquo; heads which become animated. Small objects come alive. A small artist&rsquo;s mannequin holds a flowerpot sprouting tiny plumes. There is attention to the smallest objects and details. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 697.33px; height: 586.73px;"><img alt="A pair of hands holding a pair of silver plates

It breaks expectations. I did make these objects, then I animated them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c4">Confessions to the Mirror</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was a huge challenge, because I worked with Cahun&rsquo;s writing </span><span class="c3 c4">Confidences au miroir</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1945-1954) a memoire of her time in the resistance in Jersey during the Second World War. Different voices speak in English and sometimes in French, lines from Cahun&rsquo;s text over re-staged images from her photographs. It was a huge task to undertake, the translation, the editing of text and then the re-staging of it. The memoire serves in part, as a testimony of Cahun and her partner Marcel Moore&rsquo;s political propaganda campaign in Jersey under the Occupation. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c1">The voice in the film narrates moments from their imprisonment and the impact on her health and in a sense early death because of it. I felt a responsibility and I had to prioritise. It weighed on me heavily how to do this. What am I doing, what right do I have to be working with her words and these images. How to do this as a long film so that people would stay and at the same time I could be inventive in how I restage the images and bring together something of the text and the image and do something that is not just copying. I&rsquo;d say that the theme of collage is actually very central to both of my films about Cahun, how I collaged her writing with the images. It was a lot of work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">You are the maker and a set designer, the producer, camera woman behind and you perform in front of the camera and also direct performers. &nbsp;You also do the jobs that in a standard production would be delegated to a runner or assistant who might find the props, from a feather to a velvet curtain. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">That&#39;s the chaos yes. That&#39;s the chaos. Where do I get this from, where do I get that from? I was very driven to make </span><span class="c3 c4">Confessions to the Mirror</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and it was in impossible circumstances in terms of where I was working in, which is my home. I didn&#39;t really have the funds to be doing this. It was at my cost financially, but I was desperate to do it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">This gives the film&rsquo;s intensity. Can we go onto some context? What was your relationship to the London Film-makers&rsquo; Co-op [LFMC] in terms of this need to make films? When did you start going there? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">I think what I experienced there was seeing a lot of films, both early Surrealist films (by artists like Germaine Dulac, Alice Guy or Deren, who we mentioned), films from 1960s (Kenneth Anger, Jack Smith and Andy Warhol) and 1970s structural and post structural, as well as feminist and queer work, especially when Laura Hudson and Helen de Witt and were curating. I started going in 1988, 1989 when I was a student. I saw films there, a lot of radical work from different influences or fields of practice that impacted on me, that weren&rsquo;t directly from my context in London. Because of the time capsule element of film (which we mentioned before), I was exposed to work happening elsewhere, at another time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Other artists that I met there including Sandra Lahire, Sarah Turner (who was at the Slade) and Alia Syed, Vicky Smith &ndash; yes that was part of the context. Other key filmmakers possibly are Lis Rhodes, Jane Parker, Su Friedrich, Barbara Hammer from the US, or Ulrike Ottinger, she&rsquo;s somehow there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Did you engage with the feminist debates and aspects of psychoanalytic theory? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Yes, massively. I was going to everything throughout the nineties and buying and reading every book and pretty much everything on feminist theory [laughter]. And from that I was reading about the question of difference, and essentialism in terms of feminism, trying to negotiate that. This had an important impact on me. Luce Irigaray also wrote about relationship between women.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Irigaray together with Julia Kristeva and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cixous (the French feminist theory trio), were exploring ways to give definition to that which is other to phallocentricism, including the relations between women.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;I know there is homophobia and both Kristeva and Irigaray, and that psychoanalysis generally finds this work hard to accept, but as an artist I find the poesis in the writing useful in terms of creating imaginary alternatives to phallocentric language and thinking. I made a choice that my artistic references would be female, whatever the cost might be. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">And were you influenced by theories of the gaze of the time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Yes, I was interested in the gaze, thinking about the option for film to reinvent outside of the conventions that were, and continue to be, patriarchal.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s not just the form of representation but how, to re-think language, not just how we see the female in a frame &ndash; it&rsquo;s not so literal &ndash; but actually the whole language.</span><span class="c4 c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Much lesbian and feminist filmmaking retains hetero-patriarchal structures of viewing.

It went all sorts of places and possibly there was one screening at the Co-op [LFMC]. I didn&#39;t get so much shown there, but Cinenova [formerly Circles] was active and they did support me a lot. It was Cinenova which gave committed representation.</span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c4">My work was in the LFMC catalogue, so it was occasionally shown. I think Sarah Turner did one screening otherwise that was it, whereas Cinenova were much more active and sent it to festivals such as Feminale in Cologne [Germany] or Pandemonium Moving Image Art Festival 1996, London Film Festival and there was always a screening in London.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Although I was supported by the Arts Council [of Great Britain], which had a dedicated Film Unit in terms of funding, actually there was no publicity or very little. They were one-off screenings, it was pre internet. It didn&rsquo;t go in the wider contemporary art channels nor the wider film release channels. The galleries didn&rsquo;t show it, and the cinemas didn&rsquo;t, it was just in rare small spaces such as the LFMC, which then became the Lux Centre, and later the distributor &lsquo;LUX, London&rsquo;.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;After it closed there were not many screening spaces (in the early 2000s). There was the small cinema at the ICA [Institute of Contemporary Arts, London], or another small cinema at the Whitechapel Art Gallery and odd other pop-up venues, which had been there for a while anyway. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">The LFMC was at the end of its fully operational period in 1988/89.

It was very few, mostly from the US plus artists like Douglas Gordon, and some women artists associated with the YBA [Young British Artist] movement, Gill Wearing, Sam Taylor-Wood but it was a tiny amount, a handful literally I would say. Video did have this history, there were monitors in the gallery through the 1980s. In the nineties it was still this handful, mostly men. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Douglas Gordon&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3 c4">24 Hour</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">Psycho</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in 1993, at the Hayward Gallery [London].</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;was Alfred Hitchock&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3 c4">Psycho</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1960) slowed down. Thus it became an appropriated object or &lsquo;found footage&rsquo;. The emphasis went from the maker to the viewer, the reception, the critic and curator to the artist. Here there was a shift when the work of a big Hollywood director can become conceptual art work and the YBA&rsquo;s picked up on this idea of the conceptual artist with regards to art appropriation. Does it make it meaningless, or does it add a new meaning? &nbsp; In some cases the artists become curator/producers as well. &nbsp;The installation/screening was a relaxing experience and thus with a non-differentiated type of viewing where you lose yourself. What was your experience of showing single screen experimental film in the nineties in this context, and of the Lux Centre closing in 2001.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Even though there was less support in the nineties, things were still active, things were happening. There were still spaces at the Whitechapel Gallery once a year dedicated to artists &ndash; because there were fewer of us, things would happen. The moment that transition took place, when all artists were making moving image &ndash; that&#39;s where the invisibility of experimental filmmakers occurred. At the same time, all the state supported structures for distribution disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">What about the writing on experimental film? Much of the writing on artists&rsquo; film in Britain focussed on the structural period of the 1970s or artists&rsquo; moving image from the 1990s onwards. &nbsp;Recent anthologies blend the wide range of diverse practices in moving image.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c4">In the eighties </span><span class="c3 c4">Undercut</span><span class="c4">, the magazine of the LFMC, was one of few publications dedicated to experimental film in the UK. &nbsp;After </span><span class="c3 c4">Undercut</span><span class="c4">, there was </span><span class="c3 c4">Vertigo</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;which focussed on independent film (Marco Zee-Joti}, Contemporary art journals and magazines such as </span><span class="c3 c4">Frieze</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c3 c4">Art Forum</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;did not write on experimental film until perhaps later only on historical figures such as Jonas Mekas. </span><span class="c3 c4">Moving Image Review and Art Journal</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c3 c4">MIRAJ</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;established in the 2000s published on individual artists making film or moving image but by then an experimental film sector didn&rsquo;t exist as a movement as such.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s a fact that there is more literature on women experimental filmmakers from the US than in UK.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;For example, the book </span><span class="c3 c4">Women&rsquo;s Experimental Cinema: Critical Frameworks,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;edited by Robin Blaetz.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;Even though it was published in London, all the work is by US artists.

Maud Jacquin subsequently curated the programme </span><span class="c3 c4">Reel to Real</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;at the Tate.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Emile Shemilt, Mary White who has researched slide tape, Kathryn Siegal working with artists&rsquo; publications in the 70s. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll answer if I can, about critics not writing about the area. I went to many conferences on this subject. During the 1990s there were many. Some were organised by Griselda Pollock on feminist art history, others on feminist film and some on psychoanalysis and queer studies. Laura Mulvey was often speaking, along with other theorists like Jacqueline Rose and Judith Butler. At that time the ICA [Institute of Contemporary Arts, London] was a very central place for time-based media in terms of screenings and critical debate. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c4">I remember at one particular conference, committed feminist writers and critics, all day long were passionately talking about how so much feminist critical writing was focussing on mainstream films, the classics by Alfred Hitchcock and big Hollywood filmmakers and why there was comparatively so much less writing on women&rsquo;s experimental film practice? Laura Mulvey advocated that what needed to be done was to make films that critique patriarchal structures of filmmaking, and that start to offer something else. Although I can&rsquo;t remember which conference this was, at the end of a long day I distinctly remember a couple of women writers saying that the reasons for not writing about experimental or alternative feminist films had to do with career issues, that it could be suicide to dedicate hard earned time-off from teaching to write on an artist or group of artists that are unknown, because of course that makes it harder to get the writing published.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Of course, it becomes a spiral, less visibility of the work and less visibility of being written about. I feel that artists need to write about their work. It is important to be doing this and in a sense all filmmakers who have taken up space. This includes the pioneers who set up the LFMC and wrote about work, Peter Gidal, Malcolm Le Grice. They also supported themselves through teaching in art departments rather than film studies. They inserted what they had done through their own writing. I think this needs to be done. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Yes, that&rsquo;s I hope that is what we&rsquo;re contributing to now. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">I think I wanted to work with film before I got to the Slade. I actually studied theatre, painting, music and dance for my BA before the Slade. I was performing, working in Super 8 [8mm format film], I started making films then. I saw early Surrealist films and animations actually. It was at a cinema, outside the course I was doing in Manchester, but nonetheless it was impressionist for me. It was a BA in Combined Arts, at Manchester Metropolitan University (the Slade was a postgraduate course), my selected areas were Fine Art and Theatre studies, so integration between different artforms was core to the course, visual theatre and Performance Art were important elements. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c4">I saw a lot of Eastern European Surrealist animation, including</span><span>&nbsp;by Czech animator Jan &Scaron;vankmajer</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and the very early surrealist film by </span><span>Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, </span><span class="c3">L</span><span>&#39;</span><span class="c3">&Acirc;ge d&#39;Or</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">(1930). On the course, Samuel Beckett plays were being put on by students all the time. Before I arrived in London and discovered the contemporary art scene, I was making films. Probably now, looking back, that all had some impact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">That&#39;s interesting, it all makes sense now in terms of your interest in staging. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">I was studying with Douglas Gordon, and also Sarah Turner, Alia Syed, Mairead MacClean, and there was a whole different scene in Manchester. Although, my tutors were all from the London Film-makers&rsquo; Co-op and impacted on me &ndash; people like Jayne Parker, Lis Rhodes, and the artist Chris Welsby, which was a scene that I wanted to embrace. The politics of feminism I felt, could best be done through filmmaking because film is active literally and politically. I understood from the feminist film landscape at the time that pervaded books, films and conversations, all that I was being exposed to, that this space for experimental film was a very important space for critiquing and offering alternatives.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;What is important is that it was not about critiquing but about making. That seemed such an important valuable thing to do. I was married to the idea of making alternative, critical and economically independent films and didn&#39;t think about the gallery thing which I thought &nbsp;was just commercial. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">And how is your work shown today? Where do you show it, is it in festivals and in galleries? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">I&#39;m currently making a film installation for Ottawa Art Gallery in a group show on Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;I&#39;m taking a section from </span><span class="c3 c4">Confessions</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;using water reflections, so the installation is a re-working of a part of the film into something new. I made two long films because I believe in it as a form that is serious and committed. I value the long-form as an artist&rsquo;s experimental work because you&#39;re not shoved against other shorts in screening programmes. &nbsp;You actually take up a substantial space and there&rsquo;s usually a question and answer session. I even think that you can have long film in a gallery but there are people who will say, no you can&#39;t. You can, people will stay; When I showed &lsquo;Magic Mirror&rsquo; at the Nunnery Gallery, people did stay. &nbsp;When they are committed, they&rsquo;ll go back but I am experimenting now with installation. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">What are your thoughts about making experimental film as a form now? Obviously, the context for experimental filmmaking, which included seeing women&#39;s work, showing and discussing it was the context in which it flourished. Also making work in relation to and alongside, often in the same space as other filmmakers, disappeared as an infrastructure. &nbsp; Do you see it as a historical moment? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">I&#39;d like to pick up the last bit, on experimental film w</span><span>ithin the context of contemporary fine art, which is the subject that I have taught for three decades. Within this environment, which tends to focus on commercial galleries, art museums, the art press, experimental film largely isn&rsquo;t acknowledged within this sphere. I was part of two recent touring screenings of women&rsquo;s experimental film, one curated by Maud Jacquin for the Tate Modern (the </span><span class="c3">Reel to Reel</span><span>&nbsp;programmes we mentioned before) and another by the curator Selina Robertson and artist Beverly Zalcock. Only one of these was funded, with those working on the other unpaid. The Tate screening went to a few venues internationally. This is all I have witnessed recently. Even today, Cinenova are unfunded and operate not as distributors but as curators with an archive, which means there is no accountability to the filmmakers in the archive. Experimental film artists are not therefore supported in the way for example an artist is &ndash; who is represented by a gallery or by a distributor. My point is that with regard to publicity which affects the funding of experimental film, you can&rsquo;t get funding from The Arts Council if there is no gallery to show the work and this work doesn&rsquo;t get shown in galleries and it is unlikely to be reviewed after one night&rsquo;s screening. It is the nature of a single screen film that unless there is funding, it can&rsquo;t survive with visibility within the commercial sphere that we have in the UK now, and this was different in the eighties. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c4">Experimental film is not really about the now - that&#39;s true, but that doesn&#39;t make it not an interesting thing to seek out in a book or to actually see that work now, which makes it contemporary at the time of viewing. We&rsquo;re talking about this &lsquo;now&rsquo;, as a moment in the past. The past is only ever lived in the present. That time period &lsquo;in the past&rsquo; of woman&#39;s work is relevant for me &lsquo;now&rsquo; and in this sense is actually contemporary.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;I&#39;m always thinking about my work in terms of other female artists historical and contemporary, who have been my influence. It&rsquo;s my reference point. Many of those artists working in the nineties are still making work now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">In the late eighties early nineties there were screenings of women&rsquo;s experimental film at the London Filmmakers&rsquo; Co-op which followed those programmed by Laura Hudson, Helen de Witt, Sarah Turner, Moira Sweeney, Sara Maitland-Carter, Emina Kurtagic and Felicity Sparrow and Lis Rhodes at Circles and the film theorist Bev Zalcock&rsquo;s programmes for City Lit London.</span><span>&nbsp;Then e</span><span class="c4">xperimental film became the subject of anthologies such as A.L. Rees&rsquo; </span><span class="c3 c4">A History of Experimental Film and Video</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(1999), David Curtis&rsquo; </span><span class="c3 c4">A History of Artists&rsquo; Film and Video in Britain</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(2006). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">So, we are talking about an approach to experimental film. &nbsp;Film has a material emphasis, which is a different relationship to what is termed artists&rsquo; moving image. The critical context in the seventies and eighties in the UK developed film practices which combined theoretical rigour with material practice. &nbsp;There is a relationship between a material practice with a subjective emphasis in these conversations. It is being considered as a particular, perhaps unique set of relationships. Having these conversations is a way of trying to work out this particular place of practice and its material, historical, contextual, critical intersections and how we are practicing now. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">It is very true what you are highlighting here Nina, the crux is the relationship between the film material that was and can only be through the hands-on relationship we had with the celluloid, and cameras and how that connected with both an emotional but also theoretical political critique. These women were reinventing their language of deconstructing patriarchal film structures and finding new spaces of language. What really matters first of all is that it&#39;s an incredibly valuable history and moment in time and it hasn&#39;t been acknowledged. It&#39;s very important to have this work remembered and seen and understood and I&#39;m sure that it will be. There&#39;s so much there. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span>These films that we are saying are important and in many cases (examples in this interview series) almost entirely unacknowledged, were </span><span class="c4">funded by the Arts Council of Great Britain [later Arts Council England], by the BFI [British Film Institute], by Carlton Television (who funded my work), in other terrestrial television channels, including Channel Four&rsquo;s department dedicated to independent film and video and workshop funding (during the eighties). I am thinking of artists like Jayne Parker and you who received funding from Channel 4 and initiatives like the London Production Fund. The British Council funded people to take their work to festivals, to distribute it. There was a lot of financial support for this work in the eighties and nineties. Institutions like the LFMC, then LUX, Circles/Cinenova, Four Corners, and other institutions nationally were funding to support this work. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c4">The work was important enough to invest considerable sums for production and distribution. These filmmakers studied and are or were teaching at the Slade, Goldsmiths University, the Royal College of Art, Kingston School of Art, Central Saint Martins, the University of Westminster. They were making important work that was acknowledged in Europe and was circulating internationally.</span><span>&nbsp;The demise of funding for this has meant that to a significant extent </span><span class="c1">the door was closed, and this needs to be revived for posterity. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c4">I find from discussions with students that there is a huge interest, in people wanting to know about experimental film and in particular feminist and women&rsquo;s practices within it. I think it will take time for it to be threaded through, for people to see that this isn&#39;t the same as doing a performance and recording it. The difference is that the visual language is what conveys its meaning and its artistic merit &ndash; which might also engage with less obvious forms of communication such as what the images represent or what a voice is saying. Rather, the point in experimental cinema, is the signification of the language. In this way, otherwise invisible or unconscious elements are given space and considered. It is less about what we see in literal terms, for example a man crossing a road; but instead it is the camera position, lens frame, lighting, static or hand held, the exposure, the edit decision, sounds that might counter what you see in front of the lens, the speed. Simply put, it experiments with language but towards different ends. Often artists&rsquo; moving image is about what is &lsquo;recorded&rsquo; and the content. This more literal approach dominates much current work where an overriding idea or concept is imposed upon the film. The visual language itself is on the whole treated as if it were a transparent form. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">The films discussed in these conversations are in the place of a subjective position. In the programme you curated, </span><span class="c3 c4">The Subjective Camera</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;you say that the individual filmmaker is at the centre of their own filmmaking process.</span><sup class="c4 c5"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;The technical and theoretical rigour combines with the filmmaker&rsquo;s subjective investment that was all part of the visual language of the work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span>For the </span><span class="c3">Subjective Camera</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;screenings that I curated, the subjectivity of the film and the filmmaker is also inhabited by the spectator. This is how I understand it and why I am still happy with the idea of the subjective (and this inhabitation is significant in my Cahun films). </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c1">I think that element of subjective inhabitation is absolutely central, it is very important particularly, unregulated, institutionalised mark of the artist, the lived experience of an artist negotiating social and political contexts through an embodied aesthetic, where image and sound and movement are coming together in a highly controlled work. We are not speaking about wanting to celebrate individualism; instead, it is about seeking a freedom that might open up new spaces, of resisting the subtleties of conventions that make up the languages we live in. I think of Sandra Lahire, yourself, Jayne Parker, Lis Rhodes, Maria Klonaris and Katerina Thomadaki and others included in this collection of conversations. These practices are highly crafted and composed. </span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c1">That sense of composing something. &nbsp;what&rsquo;s important about inhabitation is that it is not just the literal. It is not just about employing the use of the first person, &lsquo;I&rsquo;, this is more like the process where there is a close relationship with the materials so unconscious elements become embedded in the work. For example, as I was saying to you about suddenly thinking about my mother in front of the mirror when I was a small child. That had never occurred to me before. It&rsquo;s hitting me now as we speak about it maybe because my mother has just died. The point is that when something is unconscious in the work, this is where things start to speak in ways that are beyond the literal or the known.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Yes, that is a really important insight from this conversation although it is there as well in the unconscious of the film. It is also part of the need to make the film which is inscribed in the film&rsquo;s unconscious. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sarah Pucill: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">You live it. It is part of the unconscious: you are not aware of it but it&rsquo;s there all the time. Simply put it is about not being obvious and allowing readings of the work to take time. I remember seeing a film of Jayne Parkers and then 10 years later I thought &ldquo;now I understand what that is&rdquo;. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nina Danino: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">To finish, earlier on you were talking about the subconscious as a way through which you could understand how you might be a subject in your work. This seems to be something that partly one has control over, but partly it&#39;s something that is a drive or need, that has an influence on one&rsquo;s work, without you necessarily recognising it at the time, although later on one can reflect on it. Because after all, experimental films are a form about what can&rsquo;t be verbalised and that&rsquo;s precisely why we have practiced this as a form because it enables one to say what otherwise can&#39;t be said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 688.18px; height: 420.56px;"><img src="https://luxmicrosite.github.io/lux-html-pages//image6.jpg" alt="Image"> style="width: 688.18px; height: 420.56px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Still from Sarah Pucill, </span><span class="c3 c4">Confessions to the Mirror</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(2016). </span><span>Copyright: Sarah Pucill.
